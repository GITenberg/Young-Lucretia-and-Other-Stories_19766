<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Who's that little gal goin' by?" said old Mrs.
Emmons.</p>

<p>"That&mdash;why, that's young Lucretia, mother,"
replied her daughter Ann, peering out of the
window over her mother's shoulder. There was
a fringe of flowering geraniums in the window;
the two women had to stretch their heads over
them.</p>

<p>"Poor little soul!" old Mrs. Emmons remarked
further. "I pity that child."</p>

<p>"I don't see much to pity her for," Ann returned,
in a voice high-pitched and sharply sweet;
she was the soprano singer in the village choir.
"I don't see why she isn't taken care of as well
as most children."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know but she's took care of,
but I guess she don't get much coddlin'. Lucretia
an' Maria ain't that kind&mdash;never was. I heerd
the other day they was goin' to have a Christmas-tree
down to the school-house. Now I'd be will-in'
to ventur' consider'ble that child don't have
a thing on't."</p>

<p>"Well, if she's kept clean an' whole, an' made
to behave, it amounts to a good deal more'n
Christmas presents, I suppose." Ann sat down
and turned a hem with vigor: she was a dress-maker.</p>

<p>"Well, I s'pose it does, but it kinder seems as
if that little gal ought to have somethin'. Do
you remember them little rag babies I used to
make for you, Ann? I s'pose she'd be terrible
tickled with one. Some of that blue thibet would
be jest the thing to make it a dress of."</p>

<p>"Now, mother, you ain't goin' to fussing. She
won't think anything of it."</p>

<p>"Yes, she would, too. You used to take sights
of comfort with 'em." Old Mrs. Emmons, tall
and tremulous, rose up and went out of the room.</p>

<p>"She's gone after the linen pieces," thought
her daughter Ann. "She is dreadfully silly."
Ann began smoothing out some remnants of blue
thibet on her lap. She selected one piece that
she thought would do for the dress.</p>

<p>Meanwhile young Lucretia went to school. It
was quite a cold day, but she was warmly dressed.
She wore her aunt Lucretia's red and green plaid
shawl, which Aunt Lucretia had worn to meeting
when she was herself a little girl, over her aunt
Maria's black ladies' cloth coat. The coat was
very large and roomy&mdash;indeed, it had not been
altered at all&mdash;but the cloth was thick and good.
Young Lucretia wore also her aunt Maria's black
alpaca dress, which had been somewhat decreased
in size to fit her, and her aunt Lucretia's purple
hood with a nubia tied over it. She had mittens,
a black quilted petticoat, and her aunt Maria's
old drab stockings drawn over her shoes to keep
the snow from her ankles. If young Lucretia
caught cold, it would not be her aunts' fault.
She went along rather clumsily, but quite merrily,
holding her tin dinner-pail very steady. Her
aunts had charged her not to swing it, and "get
the dinner in a mess."</p>

<p>Young Lucretia's face, with very pink cheeks,
and smooth lines of red hair over the temples,
looked gayly and honestly out of the hood and
nubia. Here and there along the road were
sprigs of evergreen and ground-pine and hemlock.
Lucretia glanced a trifle soberly at them.
She was nearly in sight of the school-house when
she reached Alma Ford's house, and Alma came
out and joined her. Alma was trim and pretty
in her fur-bordered winter coat and her scarlet
hood.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Lucretia!" said Alma.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" responded Lucretia. Then the two
little girls trotted on together: the evergreen
sprigs were growing thicker. "Did you go?"
asked Lucretia, looking down at them.</p>

<p>"Yes; we went way up to the cross-roads.
They wouldn't let you go, would they?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lucretia, smiling broadly.</p>

<p>"I think it was <i>mean</i>," said Alma.</p>

<p>"They said they didn't approve of it," said
Lucretia, in a serious voice, which seemed like an
echo of some one else's.</p>

<p>When they got to the school-house it took her
a long time to unroll herself from her many
wrappings. When at last she emerged there was
not another child there who was dressed quite
after her fashion. Seen from behind, she looked
like a small, tightly-built old lady. Her little
basque, cut after her aunt's own pattern, rigorously
whaleboned, with long straight seams,
opened in front; she wore a dimity ruffle, a
square blue bow to fasten it, and a brown gingham
apron. Her sandy hair was parted rigorously
in the middle, brought over her temples in
two smooth streaky scallops, and braided behind
in two tight tails, fastened by a green bow.
Young Lucretia was a homely little girl, although
her face was always radiantly good-humored.
She was a good scholar, too, and could
spell and add sums as fast as anybody in the
school.</p>

<p>In the entry, where she took off her things, there
was a great litter of evergreen and hemlock; in
the farthest corner, lopped pitifully over on its
side, was a fine hemlock-tree. Lucretia looked
at it, and her smiling face grew a little serious.</p>

<p>"That the Christmas-tree out there?" she said
to the other girls when she went into the school-room.
The teacher had not come, and there was
such an uproar and jubilation that she could
hardly make herself heard. She had to poke
one of the girls two or three times before she
could get her question answered.</p>

<p>"What did you say, Lucretia Raymond?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"That the Christmas-tree out there?"</p>

<p>"Course 'tis. Say, Lucretia, can't you come
this evening and help trim? the boys are a-going
to set up the tree, and we're going to trim. Say,
can't you come?"</p>

<p>Then the other girls joined in: "Can't you
come, Lucretia?&mdash;say, can't you?"</p>

<p>Lucretia looked at them all, with her honest
smile. "I don't believe I can," said she.</p>

<p>"Won't they let you?&mdash;won't your aunts let
you?"</p>

<p>"Don't believe they will."</p>

<p>Alma Ford stood back on her heels and threw
back her chin. "Well, I don't care," said she.
"I think your aunts are <i>awful mean</i>&mdash;so there!"</p>

<p>Lucretia's face got pinker, and the laugh died
out of it. She opened her lips, but before she
had a chance to speak, Lois Green, who was one
of the older girls, and an authority in the school,
added her testimony. "They are two mean,
stingy old maids," she proclaimed; "that's what
they are."</p>

<p>"They're not neither," said Lucretia, unexpectedly.
"You sha'n't say such things about my
aunts, Lois Green."</p>

<p>"Oh, you can stick up for 'em if you want to,"
returned Lois, with cool aggravation. "If you
want to be such a little gump, you can, an' nobody'll
pity you. You know you won't get a
single thing on this Christmas-tree."</p>

<p>"I will, too," cried Lucretia, who was fiery,
with all her sweetness.</p>

<p>"You won't."</p>

<p>"You see if I don't, Lois Green."</p>

<p>"You won't."</p>

<p>All through the day it seemed to her, the more
she thought of it, that she must go with the
others to trim the school-house, and she must
have something on the Christmas-tree. A keen
sense of shame for her aunts and herself was over
her; she felt as if she must keep up the family
credit.</p>

<p>"I wish I could go to trim this evening," she
said to Alma, as they were going home after
school.</p>

<p>"Don't you believe they'll let you?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe they'll 'prove of it," Lucretia
answered, with dignity.</p>

<p>"Say, Lucretia, do you s'pose it would make
any difference if my mother should go up to your
house an' ask your aunts?"</p>

<p>Lucretia gave her a startled look: a vision of
her aunt's indignation at such interference shot
before her eyes. "Oh, I don't believe it would
do a mite of good," said she, fervently. "But
I tell you what 'tis, Alma, you might come home
with me while I ask."</p>

<p>"I will," said Alma, eagerly. "Just wait a
minute till I ask mother if I can."</p>

<p>But it was all useless. Alma's pretty, pleading
little face as a supplement to Lucretia's, and her
timorous, "Please let Lucretia go," had no effect
whatever.</p>

<p>"I don't approve of children being out nights,"
said Aunt Lucretia, and Aunt Maria supported
her. "There's no use talking," said she; "you
can't go, Lucretia. Not another word. Take
your things off, and sit down and sew your square
of patchwork before supper. Almy, you'd better
run right home; I guess your mother'll be wanting
you to help her." And Alma went.</p>

<p>"What made you bring that Ford girl in
here to ask me?" Aunt Lucretia, who had seen
straight through her namesake's artifice, asked
of young Lucretia.</p>

<p>"I don't know," stammered Lucretia, over her
patchwork.</p>

<p>"You'll never go anywhere any quicker for
taking such means as that," said Aunt Lucretia.</p>

<p>"It would serve you right if we didn't let you
go to the Christmas-tree," declared Aunt Maria,
severely, and young Lucretia quaked. She had
had the promise of going to the Christmas-tree
for a long time. It would be awful if she should
lose that. She sewed very diligently on her
patchwork. A square a day was her stent, and
she had held up before her the rapture and glory
of a whole quilt made all by herself before she
was ten years old.</p>

<p>Half an hour after tea she had the square all
done. "I've got it done," said she, and she
carried it over to her aunt Lucretia that it might
be inspected.</p>

<p>Aunt Lucretia put on her spectacles and looked
closely at it. "You've sewed it very well," she
said, finally, in a tone of severe commendation.</p>

<p>"You can sew well enough if you put your mind
to it."</p>

<p>"That's what I've always told her," chimed in
Aunt Maria. "There's no sense in her slighting
her work so, and taking the kind of stitches she
does sometimes. Now, Lucretia, it's time for you
to go to bed."</p>

<p>Lucretia went lingeringly across the wide old
sitting-room, then across the old wide dining-room,
into the kitchen. It was quite a time before
she got her candle lighted and came back, and
then she stood about hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"What are you waiting for?" Aunt Lucretia
asked, sharply. "Take care; you're tipping your
candle over; you'll get the grease on the carpet."</p>

<p>"Why don't you mind what you're doing?"
said Aunt Maria.</p>

<p>Young Lucretia had scant encouragement to
open upon the subject in her mind, but she did.
"They're going to have lots of presents on the
Christmas-tree," she remarked, tipping her candle
again.</p>

<p>"Are you going to hold that candle straight
or not?" cried Aunt Lucretia. "Who is going
to have lots of presents?"</p>

<p>"All the other girls."</p>

<p>When the aunts got very much in earnest
about anything they spoke with such vehement
unison that it had the effect of a duet; it was
difficult to tell which was uppermost. "Well,
the other girls can have lots of presents; if their
folks want to get presents for 'em they can,"
said they. "There's one thing about it, you won't
get anything, and you needn't expect anything.
I never approved of this giving presents Christmas,
anyway. It's an awful tax an' a foolish
piece of business."</p>

<p>Young Lucretia's lips quivered so she could
hardly speak. "They'll think it's&mdash;so&mdash;funny
if&mdash;I don't have&mdash;anything," she said.</p>

<p>"Let 'em think it's funny if they want to. You
take your candle an' go to bed, an' don't say
any more about it. Mind you hold that candle
straight."</p>

<p>Young Lucretia tried to hold the candle straight
as she went up-stairs, but it was hard work, her
eyes were so misty with tears. Her little face
was all puckered up with her silent crying as
she trudged wearily up the stairs. It was a long
time before she got to sleep that night. She
cried first, then she meditated. Young Lucretia
was too small and innocent to be artful, but she
had a keen imagination, and was fertile of resources
in emergencies. In the midst of her
grief and disappointment she devolved a plan for
keeping up the family honor, hers and her aunts',
before the eyes of the school.</p>

<p>The next day everything favored the plan.
School did not keep; in the afternoon both the
aunts went to the sewing society. They had
been gone about an hour when young Lucretia
trudged down the road with her arms full of
parcels. She stole so quietly and softly into the
school-house, where they were arranging the tree,
that no one thought about it. She laid the parcels
on a settee with some others, and stole out
and flew home.</p>

<p>The festivities at the school-house began at
seven o'clock. There were to be some exercises,
some recitations and singing, then the distribution
of the presents. Directly after tea young
Lucretia went up to her own little chamber to
get ready. She came down in a surprisingly
short time all dressed.</p>

<p>"Are you all ready?" said Aunt Lucretia.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," replied young Lucretia. She
had her hand on the door-latch.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you are half dressed," said
Aunt Maria. "Did you get your bow on
straight?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"I think she'd better take her things off, an'
let us be sure," said Aunt Lucretia. "I'm not
goin' to have her down there with her clothes on
any which way, an' everybody making remarks.
Take your sacque off, Lucretia."</p>

<p>"Oh, I got the bow on straight; it's real
straight, it is, <i>honest</i>," pleaded young Lucretia,
piteously. She clutched the plaid shawl tightly
together, but it was of no use&mdash;off the things had
to come. And young Lucretia had put on the
prim whaleboned basque of her best dress wrong
side before; she had buttoned it in the back.
There she stood, very much askew and uncomfortable
about the shoulder seams and sleeves,
and hung her head before her aunts.</p>

<p>"Lucretia Raymond, what <i>do</i> you mean, putting
your dress on this way?"</p>

<p>"All&mdash;the other&mdash;girls&mdash;wear&mdash;theirs buttoned
in&mdash;the back."</p>

<p>"All the other girls! Well, you're not going
to have yours buttoned in the back, and wear
holes through that nice ladies' cloth coat every
time you lean back against a chair. I should
think you were crazy. I've a good mind not to
let you go out at all. Stand round here!"</p>

<p>Young Lucretia's basque was sharply unbuttoned,
she was jerked out of it, and it was turned
around and fastened as it was meant to be.
When she was finally started, with her aunts'
parting admonition echoing after her, she felt sad
and doubtful, but soon her merry disposition asserted
itself.</p>

<p>There was no jollier and more radiant little
soul than she all through the opening exercises.
She listened to the speaking and the singing with
the greatest appreciation and delight. She sat
up perfectly straight in her prim and stiff
basque; she folded her small red hands before
her; her two tight braids inclined stiffly towards
her ears, and her face was all aglow with smiles.</p>

<p>When the distribution of presents began her
name was among the first called. She arose
with alacrity, and went with a gay little prance
down the aisle. She took the parcel that the
teacher handed to her; she commenced her journey
back, when she suddenly encountered the
eyes of her aunt Lucretia and her aunt Maria.
Then her terror and remorse began. She had
never dreamed of such a thing as her aunts coming&mdash;indeed,
they had not themselves. A neighbor
had come in and persuaded them, and they
had taken a sudden start against their resolutions
and their principles.</p>

<p>Young Lucretia's name was called again and
again. Every time she slunk more reluctantly
and fearfully down to the tree; she knew that
her aunts' eyes were surveying her with more
and more amazement.</p>

<p>After the presents were all distributed she sat
perfectly still with hers around her. They lay
on her desk, and the last one was in her lap.
She had not taken off a single wrapping. They
were done up neatly in brown paper, and Lucretia's
name was written on them.</p>

<p>Lucretia sat there. The other girls were
in a hubbub of delight all around her, comparing
their presents, but she sat perfectly
still and watched her aunts coming. They
came slowly; they stopped to speak to the
teacher. Aunt Lucretia reached young Lucretia
first.</p>

<p>"What have you got there?" she asked. She
did not look cross, but a good deal surprised.
Young Lucretia just gazed miserably up at her.
"Why don't you undo them?" asked Aunt Lucretia.
Young Lucretia shook her head helplessly.
"Why, what makes you act so, child?"
cried Aunt Lucretia, getting alarmed. Then
Aunt Maria came up, and there was quite a little
group around young Lucretia. She began to cry.
"What on earth ails the child?" said Aunt Lucretia.
She caught up one of the parcels and
opened it; it was a book bound in red and gold.
She held it close to her eyes; she turned it this
way and that; she examined the fly-leaf.
"Why," said she, "it's the old gift-book Aunt
Susan gave me when I was eighteen years old!
What in the world!"</p>

<p>Aunt Maria had undone another. "This is
the <i>Floral Album</i>," she said, tremulously;
"we always keep it in the north parlor on
the table. Here's my name in it. I don't
see&mdash;"</p>

<p>Aunt Lucretia speechlessly unmuffled a clove
apple and a nautilus shell that had graced the
parlor shelf; then a little daintily dressed rag
doll with cheeks stained pink with cranberry juice
appeared. When young Lucretia spied this last
she made a little grab at it.</p>

<p>"Oh," she sobbed, "somebody did hang this
on for me! They did&mdash;they did! It's mine!"</p>

<p>It never seemed to young Lucretia that she
walked going home that night; she had a feeling
that only her tiptoes occasionally brushed
the earth; she went on rapidly, with a tall aunt
on either side. Not much was said. Once in a
lonely place in the road there was a volley of
severe questions from her aunts, and young Lucretia
burst out in a desperate wail. "Oh!" she
cried, "I was going to put 'em right back again,
I was! I've not hurt 'em any. I was real careful.
I didn't s'pose you'd know it. Oh, they
said you were cross an' stingy, an' wouldn't hang
me anything on the tree, an' I didn't want 'em
to think you were. I wanted to make 'em think
I had things, I did."</p>

<p>"What made you think of such a thing?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think you would know. I never
heard of such doings in my life!"</p>

<p>After they got home not much was said to
young Lucretia; the aunts were still too much bewildered
for many words. Lucretia was bidden
to light her candle and go to bed, and then came
a new grief, which was the last drop in the
bucket for her. They confiscated her rag doll,
and put it away in the parlor with the clove
apple, the nautilus shell, and the gift-book. Then
the little girl's heart failed her, remorse for she
hardly knew what, terror, and the loss of the
sole comfort that had come to her on this pitiful
Christmas Eve were too much.</p>

<p>"Oh," she wailed, "my rag baby! my rag
baby! I&mdash;want my&mdash;rag baby. Oh! oh! oh! I
want her, I want her."</p>

<p>Scolding had no effect. Young Lucretia sobbed
out her complaint all the way up-stairs, and her
aunts could distinguish the pitiful little wail of,
"my rag baby, I want my rag baby," after she
was in her chamber.</p>

<p>The two women looked at each other. They
had sat uneasily down by the sitting-room fire.</p>

<p>"I must say that I think you're rather hard
on her, Lucretia," said Maria, finally.</p>

<p>"I don't know as I've been any harder on her
than you have," returned Lucretia. "I shouldn't
have said to take away that rag baby if I'd said
just what I thought."</p>

<p>"I think you'd better take it up to her, then,
and stop that crying," said Maria.</p>

<p>Lucretia hastened into the north parlor without
another word. She carried the rag baby up-stairs
to young Lucretia; then she came down
to the pantry and got a seed-cake for her. "I
thought the child had better have a little bite of
something; she didn't eat scarcely a mite of supper,"
she explained to Maria. She had given
young Lucretia's head a hard pat when she bestowed
the seed-cake, and bade her eat it and go
right to sleep. The little girl hugged her rag
baby and ate her cooky in bliss.</p>

<p>The aunts sat a while longer by the sitting-room
fire. Just before they left it for the night
Lucretia looked hesitatingly at Maria, and said,
"I s'pose you have noticed that wax doll down
to White's store, 'ain't you?"</p>

<p>"That big wax one with the pink dress?"
asked Maria, faintly and consciously.</p>

<p>"Yes. There was a doll's bedstead there, too.
I don't know as you noticed."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I did, now you speak of it. I
noticed it the day I went in for the calico. There
was a doll baby's carriage there, too."</p>

<p>The aunts looked at each other. "I s'pose it
would be dreadful foolish," said Lucretia.</p>

<p>"She'd be 'most too tickled to live," remarked
Maria.</p>

<p>"Well, we can't buy 'em to-night anyway,"
said Lucretia. "I must light the candles an' lock
up."</p>

<p>The next day was Christmas. It was about
three o'clock in the afternoon when old Mrs. Emmons
went up the road to the Raymond house.
She had a little parcel. When she came into the
sitting-room there was young Lucretia in a
corner, so that the room should not get in a mess,
with her wealth around her. She looked forth,
a radiant little mother of dolls, from the midst
of her pretty miniature house-keeping.</p>

<p>"My sakes!" cried old Mrs. Emmons, "isn't
that complete? She's got a big wax doll, an' a
bedstead, an' a baby-carriage, an' a table an'
bureau. I declare! Well, I don't know what I
should have thought when I was a little gal.
An' I've brought some pieces for you to make
some more dresses for the rag baby, if you want
to."</p>

<p>Young Lucretia's eyes shone.</p>

<p>"You were real kind to think of it," said Aunt
Lucretia; "an' she'll take real comfort making
the dresses. I'm real glad you came in, Mis'
Emmons. I've been going down to see you for
a long time. I want to see Ann, too; I thought
I'd see if she hadn't got a pattern of a dress that
buttons up in the back for Lucretia."</p>

<p>Young Lucretia's eyes shone more than ever,
and she smiled out of her corner like a little star.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_FIDELIA_WENT_TO_THE_STORE" id="HOW_FIDELIA_WENT_TO_THE_STORE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">HOW FIDELIA WENT TO THE STORE</a></h2>


<p>"I don't know what we're goin' to do," said
Aunt Maria Crooker. She sat in a large arm-chair,
and held in her lap a bowl of sugar and
butter that she was creaming. Aunt Maria filled
up the chair from arm to arm, for she was very
portly; she had a large, rosy, handsome face, and
she creamed with such energy that she panted
for breath.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know, either," rejoined her sister,
Mrs. Lennox. "I can't go to the store with
my lame foot, that's certain."</p>

<p>"Well, I know <i>I</i> can't," said Aunt Maria, with
additional emphasis. "I haven't walked two
mile for ten year, an' I don't believe I could get
to that store and back to save my life."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you could, either. I don't
know what is goin' to be done. We can't make
the cake without raisins, anyhow. It's the queerest
thing how father happened to forget them.
Now here he is gone over to East Dighton after
the new cow, and Cynthy gone to Keene to buy
her bonnet, an' me with a scalt foot, an' you not
able to walk, an' not one raisin in the house to
put into that weddin'-cake."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lennox stated the case in full, with a despairing
eloquence, and Aunt Maria sighed and
wrinkled her forehead.</p>

<p>"If there were only any neighbors you could
borrow from," she observed.</p>

<p>"Well, there ain't any neighbors 'twixt here
and the store except the Allens and the Simmonses,
and the Allens are so tight they never
put raisins into their Thanksgivin' pies. Mis'
Allen told me they didn't. She said she thought
most folks made their pies too rich, an' her folks
liked them just as well without raisins. An' as
for the Simmonses, I don't believe they see a raisin
from one year's end to the other. They're
lucky if they can get enough common things to
eat for all those children. I don't know what's
goin' to be done. Here's the dress-maker comin'
to-morrow, an' Cynthy goin' to be married in two
weeks, and the cake ought to be made to-day if
it's ever goin' to be."</p>

<p>"Yes, it had," assented Aunt Maria. "We've
put it off full long enough, anyway. Weddin'-cake
ain't near so good unless it stands a little while."</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>Just then there was a shrill, prolonged squeak.
It came from the yard. The doors and windows
were open; it was a very warm day.</p>

<p>"What's that?" cried Aunt Maria.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's nothin' but Fidelia's little wagon.
She's draggin' it round the yard."</p>

<p>The two women looked at each other; it was as
if a simultaneous idea had come suddenly to them.</p>

<p>Aunt Maria gave expression to it first. "Fidelia
couldn't go, could she?"</p>

<p>"Maria Crooker, that little thing! She ain't
six years old, an' she's never been anywhere
alone. Do you s'pose I'm goin' to send her a
mile to that store?" Mrs. Lennox's tone was full
of vehement indignation, but her eyes still met
Aunt Maria's with that doubtful and reflective
expression.</p>

<p>"I don't see a mite of harm in it," Aunt Maria
maintained, sturdily. She set her bowl of sugar
and butter on the table, and leaned forward with
a hand on each aproned knee. "I know Fidelia
ain't but five year old, but she's brighter than
some children of seven. It's just a straight road
to the store, an' she can't get lost, to save her
life. And she knows where 'tis. You took her
down to Mis' Rose's three or four weeks ago,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that day father went down for grain.
I s'pose she would remember."</p>

<p>"Of course she'd remember. I don't see one
thing, as far as I'm concerned, to hinder that
child's goin' down to the store an' bringin' home
some raisins. I used to go on errands before I
was as old as she is. Folks didn't fuss over their
children so much in my day."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Lennox, finally, with a great
sigh, "I don't know but I may as well send her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lennox was much smaller than her sister,
and she had a rather sickly but pleasant face.
She had to push a chair before her as she walked,
for she had scalded her foot quite badly the week
before, and it was now all swathed in bandages.
It had been a very unfortunate accident in more
ways than one, for Cynthia, her elder daughter,
was going to be married soon, and the family
were busily engaged in the wedding preparations.
It was very hard for poor Mrs. Lennox to
have to limp about with one knee in a chair,
while she made wedding-cake and arranged for
the bridal festivities, but she made the best of it.</p>

<p>Now she pushed over to the door, and called,
"Fidelia! Fidelia!"</p>

<p>Directly the squeak increased to an agonizing
degree, the rattle of small wheels accompanied
it, and Fidelia came trudging around the corner
of the house. She was a chubby little girl, and
her blue tier seemed rather tight for her. She
had a round, rosy face, and innocent and honest
black eyes. She wore a small Shaker bonnet with
a green cape, and she stubbed her toes into the
grass every step she took.</p>

<p>"Don't stub your toes so," said her mother, admonishingly.
"You'll wear your shoes all out."</p>

<p>Fidelia immediately advanced with soft pats
like a kitten. When she got into the kitchen her
mother took off her Shaker bonnet and looked at
her critically. "You'll have to have your hair
brushed," said she. "Fidelia, do you remember
how you went with mother down to Mis' Rose's
three or four weeks ago?"</p>

<p>Fidelia nodded and winked.</p>

<p>"There was a big pussy cat there, do you remember?
and Mis' Rose gave you a cooky."</p>

<p>Fidelia's affirmative wink seemed to give out
sparkles.</p>

<p>"Well, you remember how we went to the
<i>side</i> door and knocked&mdash;the door with some roses
over the top of it&mdash;and Mis' Rose came&mdash;the <i>side</i>
door?"</p>

<p>Fidelia, intensely attentive, standing before her
mother and Aunt Maria, remembered about the
side door.</p>

<p>"Well, you remember how there was a piazza
across the front of the house, don't you? Father
hitched the horse to a post there. Well, there's
another door there opening on the piazza, don't
you remember&mdash;a door with panes of glass in it
like a window?"</p>

<p>Fidelia remembered.</p>

<p>"Well, now, Fidelia, do you suppose you can
go down to the store and buy some raisins for
mother to put in sister Cynthy's weddin'-cake,
all yourself?"</p>

<p>"An' be a real smart little girl," put in Aunt
Maria.</p>

<p>Fidelia gave one ecstatic roll of her black eyes
at them, then she broke into a shout, "Lemme
go! lemme go!" She oscillated on her small
stubbed toes like a bird preparing to fly, and she
tugged energetically at her mother's apron.</p>

<p>"I'll give you a penny, an' you can buy you a
nice stick of red-and-white twisted candy," added
her mother.</p>

<p>Fidelia actually made a little dash for the door
then, but her mother caught her. "Stop!" she
said, in an admonitory voice which was quieting
to Fidelia, and made her realize that the red-and-white
candy was still in the future. "Now you
just wait a minute, an' not be in such a pucker.
You ain't goin' this way, with your apron just as
dirty as poison, and your hair all in a snarl.
You've got to have on your clean apron, and
have your hair brushed and your face washed."</p>

<p>So Fidelia climbed obediently into her high
chair, and sat with her eyes screwed up and her
fists clinched, while her mother polished her face
faithfully with a wet, soapy end of a towel, and
combed the snarls out of her hair. When it was
all done, her cheeks being very red and shiny,
and her hair very damp and smooth, when she
was arrayed in her clean starched white tier, and
had her Shaker tied on with an emphatic square
bow, she stood in the door and drank in the
parting instructions. Her eyes were wide and
intent, and her mouth drooped soberly at the
corners. The importance of the occasion had begun
to impress her. She held a penny tight in
her hand; the raisins were to be charged, it not
being judged advisable to trust Fidelia with so
much money.</p>

<p>"I don't believe that little thing can carry
three pounds of raisins," Mrs. Lennox said to
Aunt Maria. She was becoming more and more
uneasy about Fidelia's going.</p>

<p>"Let her take her little wagon an' drag 'em;
that'll be just the thing," said Aunt Maria, complacently.</p>

<p>So Fidelia started down the road, trundling
behind her the little squeaking cart. It was a
warm July day, and it was very dusty. Directly
Fidelia started she forgot her mother's injunctions
about stubbing her toes; she disappeared
in a small cloud of dust, for she walked in the
middle of the road, and flirted it up with great
delight.</p>

<div class="center"><a name="whose" id="whose"></a><a href="images/002.png">
<img src="images/002th.png" alt="image" /></a>
</div>
<p class="center">"'WHOSE LITTLE GAL AIR YOU?'"</p>

<p>In the course of the mile Fidelia met one team.
It was an old rocking chaise and a white horse,
and an old farmer was driving. He drove slower
when he came alongside of Fidelia. When he
had fairly passed her he stopped entirely, twisted
about in his seat, and raised his voice.</p>

<p>"Whose little gal air you?" he asked.</p>

<p>Fidelia was a little frightened. Instead of
giving her father's name, she gave her own with
shy precision&mdash;"Fidelia Ames Lennox," she said,
retiring into her Shaker bonnet.</p>

<p>"You ain't runnin' away, be you?"</p>

<p>Fidelia's pride was touched. "I'm going to
the store for my mother," she announced, in quite
a shrill tone. Then she took to her heels, and
the little wagon trundled after, with a wilder
squeak than ever.</p>

<p>Fidelia kept saying over to herself, "Three
pounds of your best raisins, and Mr. Lennox will
come in and pay you." Her mother and Aunt
Maria wished after she had gone that they had
written it out on a piece of paper; they had not
thought of that. But Aunt Maria said she knew
that such a bright child as Fidelia would remember
three pounds of raisins when she had been
told over and over, and charged not to come
home without them.</p>

<p>Fidelia had started about ten o'clock in the
morning, and her mother and Aunt Maria had
agreed that they would not worry if she should
not return until one o'clock in the afternoon.
That would allow more than an hour for the
mile walk each way, and give plenty of time for
a rest between; for Fidelia had been instructed
to go into the store and sit down on a stool and
rest a while before starting upon her return trip.
"Likely as not Mis' Rose will give her a cooky
or something," Aunt Maria had whispered to
Mrs. Lennox.</p>

<p>So when noon came the two women pictured
Fidelia sitting perched upon a stool in the store,
being fed with candy and cookies, and made
much of, or even eating dinner with the Rose
family. "Mis' Rose made so much of her when
you took her there before that I shouldn't wonder
a mite if she'd kept her to dinner," said Aunt
Maria. She promulgated this theory the more
strenuously when one o'clock came and Fidelia
had not appeared. "Of course that's what 'tis,"
she kept repeating. "It would take 'em a good
hour to eat dinner. I shouldn't be a bit surprised
if she didn't get here before two o'clock. I think
you're dreadful silly to worry, Jane."</p>

<p>For poor Mrs. Lennox was pushing her chair
every few minutes over to the door, where she
would stand, her face all one anxious frown,
straining her eyes for a glimpse of the small figure
trudging up the road. She had made the
blueberry dumpling that Fidelia loved for dinner,
and it was keeping warm on the back of the
stove. Neither she nor Aunt Maria had eaten a
mouthful.</p>

<p>When two o'clock came Mrs. Lennox broke
down entirely. "Oh dear!" she wailed; "oh
dear! I ought to have known better than to let
her go."</p>

<p>Aunt Maria was now pacing heavily between
her chair and the door, but she still maintained a
brave front. "For goodness' sake, Jane, don't
give up so," said she. "I don't see anything
to worry about, for my part; they're keepin'
her."</p>

<p>At half-past two Mrs. Lennox stood up with a
determined air. "I ain't goin' to wait here another
minute," said she. "I'm goin' to find her.
I don't know but she's fell into the brook, or got
run over." Mrs. Lennox's face was all drawn
with anxiety.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know how you're goin'," said Aunt
Maria.</p>

<p>"I guess I can push this chair along the road
just as well as in a room."</p>

<p>"Pretty-lookin' sight you'd be goin' a mile
with one knee in a wooden chair."</p>

<p>"I guess I don't care much how I look if I
only find&mdash;her." Mrs. Lennox's voice broke into
a wail.</p>

<p>"You just sit down and keep calm," said Aunt
Maria. "If anybody's goin', I am."</p>

<p>"Oh, you can't."</p>

<p>"Yes, I can, too. I ain't quite so far gone that
I can't walk a mile. You ain't goin' a step on
that scalt foot an' get laid up, with that weddin'
comin' off, not if I know it. I'm just goin' to
slip on my gaiter-shoes an' my sun-bonnet, an'
take the big green umbrella to keep the sun off."</p>

<p>When Aunt Maria was equipped and started,
Mrs. Lennox watched her progress down the road
with frantic impatience. It seemed to her that
she could have gone faster with her chair. Truth
was, that poor Aunt Maria, plodding heavily
along in her gaiter-shoes, holding the green umbrella
over her flaming face, made but slow and
painful progress, and it was well that Mr. Lennox
and Cynthia Lennox came home two hours before
they were expected. It was three o'clock
when Mr. Lennox came driving into the yard in
the open buggy. Cynthia, erect and blooming,
with her big bandbox in her lap, sat beside him,
and the new Jersey cow, fastened by a rope to
the tail of the buggy, came on behind with melancholy
moos. Cynthia had bought her wedding-bonnet
sooner than she had expected, so she had
come home on the three o'clock train instead of
the five; and her father had bought the cow
sooner than he had expected, and had come to
the railroad crossing just about the time that
Cynthia's train arrived. So he had stopped and
taken in her and her bandbox, and they had all
ridden home together.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lennox stood in the kitchen door when
they drove in.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother," Cynthia cried out, "I've had
splendid luck! I've got the handsomest bonnet!"</p>

<p>"I guess you won't care much about bonnets,"
answered her mother; "<i>Fidelia's lost</i>." She spoke
quite slowly and calmly, then she began to weep
wildly and lament. It was quite a time before
she could make the case plain to them, and Cynthia
and her bandbox, and Mr. Lennox and the
horse and buggy and cow, all remained before
her in a petrified halt.</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Lennox fairly understood, he
sprang out of the buggy, untied the cow, led her
into the barn, turned the team around, with a
sharp grate of the wheels, jumped in again, and
gathered up the reins. Cynthia, her rosy cheeks
quite pale, still sat in her place, and the tears
splashed on her new bandbox cover. Mrs. Lennox
had set her chair outside the door, and followed
it, with a painful effort. "Stop, father!"
she cried; "I'm goin' too!"</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, you can't!" said Mr. Lennox
and Cynthia, together.</p>

<p>"I'm goin'. You needn't say a word. Father,
you get out an' help me in."</p>

<p>Mr. Lennox got out and lifted, while Cynthia
pulled. Mrs. Lennox's injured foot suffered, but
she set her mouth hard, and said nothing. They
started at a good pace, three on a seat, with Mr.
Lennox in the middle, driving.</p>

<p>They had got about half-way to the store when
they overtook Aunt Maria. Aunt Maria, with
the green umbrella overhead, was proceeding
steadily, with a sideways motion that seemed
more effective than the forward one.</p>

<p>"I'll get out, and let her get in," said Cynthia.</p>

<p>"No," said her father; "it won't do; it 'ill
break the springs. We can't ride three on a
seat with Aunt Maria, anyhow, and I've got to
drive."</p>

<p>So they passed Aunt Maria.</p>

<p>"Don't go any farther, Aunt Maria," Cynthia
called, sobbingly, back to her. "You sit down
on the wall and rest."</p>

<p>But Aunt Maria shook her head, she could not
speak, and kept on.</p>

<p>It was quarter-past three when they reached
the Rose house and the store. The store was in
the front of the house, and the Rose family occupied
the rear portion. The house stood on a
street corner, so a good deal of it was visible, and
the whole establishment had a shut-up air; not
a single farmer's wagon stood before the store.
However, as Mr. Lennox drove up, a woman's
head appeared at a window; then a side door
opened, and she stood there. She had on a big
apron, and her face was flushed as if she had
been over the stove; she held a great wooden
spoon, too. She began talking to the Lennoxes,
but they paid no attention to her&mdash;their eyes
were riveted upon the store door. There was a
speck of white against its dark front, and suddenly
it moved. It was Fidelia's white tier.</p>

<p>"Why, there's Fidelia!" gasped Cynthia. She
jumped out, not waiting for her father to turn
the wheel, and ran to the store door. The bandbox
rolled out and the lid came off, and there
was her wedding-bonnet in the dust, but she did
not mind that. She caught Fidelia. "Oh, you
naughty little girl, where have you been all this
time?" cried she.</p>

<p>Fidelia's eyes took on a bewildered stare, her
mouth puckered more and more. She clung to
her sister, and sobbed something that was quite
inaudible. It was quite a time before her father
and mother and Cynthia and Mrs. Rose, surrounding
her with attention, could gather that the
import of it all was that she had knocked and
knocked and nobody had come to the door.</p>

<p>"<i>Knocked!</i>" gasped Mrs. Rose; "why, the
poor little lamb! Here Mr. Rose and Sam have
been away all day, an' I've been makin' currant-jell'
out in the kitchen. An' there's the bell on
the counter, that customers always ring when
there ain't anybody round. I've been listenin'
for <i>that</i> all day. It's been so hot, an' everybody
hayin', that I don't suppose a soul but her has
been near the store since nine o'clock this mornin',
and there she's stood an' knocked. I never
heard anything like it in my life. See here,
Pussy, haven't you been asleep?"</p>

<p>Fidelia shook her head in a sulky and down-cast
manner, but there was a suspiciously flushed
and creasy look about her, and they agreed that
it was more than probable that a nap on the
store steps had softened and shortened her vigil.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lennox had her up in the wagon on
her lap. She took her Shaker bonnet off, and
smoothed her hair and kissed her. "She thought
she'd got to knock, I s'pose," said she. "I ought
to have told her she didn't have to when she
went to a store. Poor little soul! mother won't
send her to the store again till she's bigger."</p>

<p>"I knocked an' knocked," wailed Fidelia, piteously.</p>

<p>She looked cross and worn out. Mrs. Rose
ran into the house, and brought out a plate of
cookies and a mug of milk, and then Fidelia sat
in her mother's lap and ate and drank and felt
comforted. But after the raisins had been finally
purchased, Cynthia's bonnet picked up out of
the dust and shaken, the little squeaking wagon
stowed under the seat of the buggy, and the
team turned around, Fidelia set up a grievous
and injured cry: "My candy! my candy! I
'ain't&mdash;got my candy!" And she held up to
view the copper cent still clutched in her moist
little fist.</p>

<p>"Poor little lamb, she shall have her candy!"
cried Mrs. Rose. Fidelia had never seen such a
handful of candy as Mrs. Rose brought out from
the store. There was a twisted red-and-white
stick of peppermint, pink checkerberry, clear barley&mdash;a
stick of every kind in the glass jars in
Mr. Rose's store window. And Mrs. Rose would
not take Fidelia's one penny at all; she bade her
keep it until she came to the store again.</p>

<p>Aunt Maria was almost up to the store when
they left it, and it was decided that she should
remain and make a call upon Mrs. Rose while Mr.
Lennox carried the others home, then he would
return for her. Aunt Maria folded her green
umbrella and sank down on the door-step, and
Mrs. Rose brought her a palm-leaf fan and a
glass of ginger water. "I 'ain't walked a mile
before for ten year," gasped Aunt Maria; "but
I'm so thankful that child's safe that I can't
think of anything else." There were tears in her
eyes as she watched the wagon-load disappearing
under the green branches of the elm-trees.
And Fidelia, in her mother's lap, rode along and
sucked a stick of barley candy in silent bliss.
Griefs in childhood soon turn to memories;
straightway, as she sucked her barley candy,
Fidelia's long and painful vigil at the store door
became a thing of the past.</p>

<p>"Grandma."</p>

<p>"What is it, child?"</p>

<p>"You goin' to put that cup-cake into the pan
to bake it now, grandma?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I guess so. It's beat 'bout enough."</p>

<p>"You ain't put in a mite of nutmeg, grandma."</p>

<p>The grandmother turned around to Ann Mary.
"Don't you be quite so anxious," said she, with
sarcastic emphasis. "I allers put the nutmeg in
cup-cake the very last thing. I ruther guess I
shouldn't have put this cake into the oven without
nutmeg!"</p>

<p>The old woman beat fiercely on the cake. She
used her hand instead of a spoon, and she held
the yellow mixing-bowl poised on her hip under
her arm. She was stout and rosy-faced. She
had crinkly white hair, and she always wore a
string of gold beads around her creasy neck. She
never took off the gold beads except to put them
under her pillow at night, she was so afraid of
their being stolen. Old Mrs. Little had always
been nervous about thieves, although none had
ever troubled her.</p>

<p>"You may go into the pantry, an' bring out
the nutmeg now, Ann Mary," said she presently,
with dignity.</p>

<p>Ann Mary soberly slipped down from her chair
and went. She realized that she had made a
mistake. It was quite an understood thing for
Ann Mary to have an eye upon her grandmother
while she was cooking, to be sure that she put in
everything that she should, and nothing that she
should not, for the old woman was absent-minded.
But it had to be managed with great delicacy,
and the corrections had to be quite irrefutable,
or Ann Mary was reprimanded for her pains.</p>

<p>When Ann Mary had deposited the nutmeg-box
and the grater at her grandmother's elbow,
she took up her station again. She sat at a corner
of the table in one of the high kitchen-chairs.
Her feet could not touch the floor, and they
dangled uneasily in their stout leather shoes, but
she never rested them on the chair round, nor
even swung them by way of solace. Ann Mary's
grandmother did not like to have her chair rounds
all marked up by shoes, and swinging feet disturbed
her while she was cooking. Ann Mary
sat up, grave and straight. She was a delicate,
slender little girl, but she never stooped. She
had an odd resemblance to her grandmother; a
resemblance more of manner than of feature.
She held back her narrow shoulders in the same
determined way in which the old woman held
her broad ones; she walked as she did, and spoke
as she did.</p>

<p>Mrs. Little was very proud of Ann Mary Evans;
Ann Mary was her only daughter's child, and
had lived with her grandmother ever since she
was a baby. The child could not remember
either her father or mother, she was so little
when they died.</p>

<p>Ann Mary was delicate, so she did not go to
the village to the public school. Miss Loretta
Adams, a young lady who lived in the neighborhood,
gave her lessons. Loretta had graduated
in a beautiful white muslin dress at the high-school
over in the village, and Ann Mary had a
great respect and admiration for her. Loretta
had a parlor-organ, and could play on it, and
she was going to give Ann Mary lessons after
Thanksgiving. Just now there was a vacation.
Loretta had gone to Boston to spend two weeks
with her cousin.</p>

<p>Ann Mary was all in brown, a brown calico
dress and a brown calico, long-sleeved apron;
and her brown hair was braided in two tight
little tails that were tied with some old brown
bonnet-strings of Mrs. Little's, and flared out
stiffly behind the ears. Once, when Ann Mary
was at her house, Loretta Adams had taken it
upon herself to comb out the tight braids and set
the hair flowing in a fluffy mass over the shoulders;
but when Ann Mary came home her grandmother
was properly indignant. She seized her
and re-braided the tails with stout and painful
jerks. "I ain't goin' to have Loretty Adams
meddlin' with your hair," said she, "an' she can
jest understand it. If she wants to have her own
hair all in a frowzle, an' look like a wild Injun,
she can; you sha'n't!"</p>

<p>And Ann Mary, standing before her grandmother
with head meekly bent and watery eyes,
decided that she would have to tell Loretta that
she mustn't touch the braids, if she proposed it
again.</p>

<p>That morning, while Mrs. Little was making
the pies, and the cake, and the pudding, Ann
Mary was sitting idle, for her part of the Thanksgiving
cooking was done. She had worked so
fast the day before and early that morning that
she had the raisins all picked over and seeded,
and the apples pared and sliced; and that was
about all that her grandmother thought she could
do. Ann Mary herself was of a different opinion;
she was twelve years old, if she <i>was</i> small for
her age, and she considered herself quite capable
of making pies and cup-cake.</p>

<p>However, it was something to sit there at the
table and have that covert sense of superintending
her grandmother, and to be reasonably sure
that some of the food would have a strange flavor
were it not for her vigilance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Little's mince-pies had all been baked the
day before; to-day, as she said, she was "making
apple and squash." While the apple-pies were in
progress, Ann Mary watched her narrowly. Her
small folded hands twitched and her little neck
seemed to elongate above her apron; but she
waited until her grandmother took up an upper
crust, and was just about to lay it over a pie.
Then she spoke up suddenly. Her voice had a
timid yet assertive chirp like a bird's.</p>

<p>"Grandma!"</p>

<p>"Well, what is it, child?"</p>

<p>"You goin' to put that crust on that pie now,
grandma?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Little stood uneasily reflective. She eyed
the pie sharply. "Yes, I be. Why?" she returned,
in a doubtful yet defiant manner.</p>

<p>"You haven't put one bit of sugar in."</p>

<p>"For the land sakes!" Mrs. Little did not
take correction of this kind happily, but when
she was made to fairly acknowledge the need of
it, she showed no resentment. She laid the upper
crust back on the board and sweetened the pie.
Ann Mary watched her gravely, but she was inwardly
complacent. After she had rescued the
pudding from being baked without the plums,
and it was nearly dinner-time, her grandfather
came home. He had been over to the village to
buy the Thanksgiving turkey. Ann Mary looked
out with delight when he drove past the windows
on his way to the barn.</p>

<p>"Grandpa's got home," said she.</p>

<p>It was snowing quite hard, and she saw the old
man and the steadily tramping white horse and
the tilting wagon through a thick mist of falling
snow-flakes.</p>

<p>Before Mr. Little came into the kitchen, his
wife warned him to be sure to wipe all the snow
from his feet, and not to track in any, so he
stamped vigorously out in the shed. Then he
entered with an air of pride. "There!" said he,
"what do ye think of that for a turkey?" Mr.
Little was generally slow and gentle in his ways,
but to-day he was quite excited over the turkey.
He held it up with considerable difficulty. He
was a small old man, and the cords on his lean
hands knotted. "It weighs a good fifteen pound',"
said he, "an' there wasn't a better one in the
store. Adkins didn't have a very big lot on
hand."</p>

<div class="center"><a name="little" id="little"></a><a href="images/003.png">
<img src="images/003th.png" alt="image" /></a>
</div>
<p class="center">MR. LITTLE SELECTS THE THANKSGIVING TURKEY</p>

<p>"I should think that was queer, the day before
Thanksgivin'," said Mrs. Little. She was examining
the turkey critically. "I guess it'll do," she
declared finally. That was her highest expression
of approbation. "Well, I rayther thought
you'd think so," rejoined the old man, beaming.
"I guess it's about as good a one as can be got&mdash;they
said 'twas, down there. Sam White he was
in there, and he said 'twas; he said I was goin'
to get it in pretty good season for Thanksgivin',
he thought."</p>

<p>"I don't think it's such very extra season, the
day before Thanksgivin'," said Mrs. Little.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think 'twas, nuther. I didn't
see jest what Sam meant by it."</p>

<p>Ann Mary was dumb with admiration. When
the turkey was laid on the broad shelf in the
pantry, she went and gazed upon it. In the
afternoon there was great enjoyment seeing it
stuffed and made ready for the oven. Indeed,
this day was throughout one of great enjoyment,
being full of the very aroma of festivity and good
cheer and gala times, and even sweeter than the
occasion which it preceded. Ann Mary had only
one damper all day, and that was the non-arrival
of a letter. Mrs. Little had invited her son and
his family to spend Thanksgiving, but now they
probably were not coming, since not a word in
reply had been received. When Mr. Little said
there was no letter in the post-office, Ann Mary's
face fell. "Oh, dear," said she, "don't you suppose
Lucy will come, grandma?"</p>

<p>"No," replied her grandmother, "I don't. Edward
never did such a thing as not to send me
word when he was comin', in his life, nor Maria
neither. I ain't no idee they'll come."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" said Ann Mary again.</p>

<p>"Well, you'll have to make up your mind to
it," returned her grandmother. She was sore
over her own disappointment, and so was irascible
towards Ann Mary's. "It's no worse for
you than for the rest of us. I guess you can
keep one Thanksgivin' without Lucy."</p>

<p>For a while it almost seemed to Ann Mary
that she could not. Lucy was her only cousin.
She loved Lucy dearly, and she was lonesome for
another little girl; nobody knew how she had
counted upon seeing her cousin. Ann Mary herself
had a forlorn hope that Lucy still might
come, even if Uncle Edward <i>was</i> always so particular
about sending word, and no word had
been received. On Thanksgiving morning she
kept running to the window and looking down
the road. But when the stage from the village
came, it passed right by the house without slackening
its speed.</p>

<p>Then there was no hope left at all.</p>

<p>"You might jest as well be easy," said her
grandmother. "I guess you can have a good
Thanksgivin' if Lucy <i>ain't</i> here. This evenin'
you can ask Loretty to come over a little while,
if you want to, an' you can make some nut-candy."</p>

<p>"Loretta ain't at home."</p>

<p>"She'll come home for Thanksgivin', I guess.
It ain't very likely she's stayed away over that.
When I get the dinner ready to take up, you can
carry a plateful down to Sarah Bean's, an'
that'll be somethin' for you to do, too. I guess
you can manage."</p>

<p>Thanksgiving Day was a very pleasant day,
although there was considerable snow on the
ground, for it had snowed all the day before.
Mr. Little and Ann Mary did not go to church
as usual, on that account.</p>

<p>The old man did not like to drive to the village
before the roads were beaten out. Mrs.
Little lamented not a little over it. It was the
custom for her husband and granddaughter to
attend church Thanksgiving morning, while she
stayed at home and cooked the dinner. "It does
seem dreadful heathenish for nobody to go to
meetin' Thanksgivin' Day," said she; "an' we
ain't even heard the proclamation read, neither.
It rained so hard last Sabbath that we couldn't
go."</p>

<p>The season was unusually wintry and severe,
and lately the family had been prevented from
church-going. It was two Sundays since any of
the family had gone. The village was three miles
away, and the road was rough. Mr. Little was
too old to drive over it in very bad weather.</p>

<p>When Ann Mary went to carry the plate of
Thanksgiving dinner to Sarah Bean, she wore a
pair of her grandfather's blue woollen socks
drawn over her shoes to keep out the snow. The
snow was rather deep for easy walking, but she
did not mind that. She carried the dinner with
great care; there was a large plate well filled,
and a tin dish was turned over it to keep it
warm. Sarah Bean was an old woman who lived
alone. Her house was about a quarter of a mile
from the Littles'.</p>

<p>When Ann Mary reached the house, she found
the old woman making a cup of tea. There did
not seem to be much of anything but tea and
bread-and-butter for her dinner. She was very
deaf and infirm, all her joints shook when she
tried to use them, and her voice quavered when
she talked. She took the plate, and her hands
trembled so that the tin dish played on the plate
like a clapper. "Why," said she, overjoyed,
"this looks just like Thanksgiving Day, tell your
grandma!"</p>

<p>"Why, it <i>is</i> Thanksgiving Day," declared Ann
Mary, with some wonder.</p>

<p>"What?" asked Sarah Bean.</p>

<p>"<i>It is Thanksgiving Day, you know.</i>" But it
was of no use, the old woman could not hear a
word. Ann Mary's voice was too low.</p>

<p>Ann Mary could not walk very fast on account
of the snow. She was absent some three-quarters
of an hour; her grandmother had told
her that dinner would be all on the table when
she returned. She was enjoying the nice things
in anticipation all the way; when she came near
the house, she could smell roasted turkey, and
there was also a sweet spicy odor in the air.</p>

<p>She noticed with surprise that a sleigh had
been in the yard. "I wonder who's come," she
said to herself. She thought of Lucy, and
whether they <i>could</i> have driven over from the
village. She ran in. "Why, who's come?" she
cried out.</p>

<p>Her voice sounded like a shout in her own
ears; it seemed to awaken echoes. She fairly
startled herself, for there was no one in the
room. There was absolute quiet through all the
house. There was even no sizzling from the kettles
on the stove, for everything had been dished
up. The vegetables, all salted and peppered and
buttered, were on the table&mdash;but the turkey was
not there. In the great vacant place where the
turkey should have been was a piece of white
paper. Ann Mary spied it in a moment. She
caught it up and looked at it. It was a note
from her grandmother:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We have had word that Aunt Betsey has had a bad turn.
Lizz wants us to come. The dinner is all ready for you.
If we ain't home to-night, you can get Loretty to stay with
you. Be a good girl. <span class="smcap">Grandma</span>.</p></div>

<p>Ann Mary read the note and stood reflecting,
her mouth drooping at the corners. Aunt Betsey
was Mrs. Little's sister; Lizz was her daughter
who lived with her and took care of her. They
lived in Derby, and Derby was fourteen miles
away. It seemed a long distance to Ann Mary,
and she felt sure that her grandparents could not
come home that night. She looked around the
empty room and sighed. After a while she sat
down and pulled off the snowy socks; she
thought she might as well eat her dinner, although
she did not feel so hungry as she had expected.
Everything was on the table but the
turkey and plum-pudding. Ann Mary supposed
these were in the oven keeping warm; the door
was ajar. But, when she looked, they were not
there. She went into the pantry; they were not
there either. It was very strange; there was the
dripping-pan in which the turkey had been
baked, on the back of the stove, with some gravy
in it; and there was the empty pudding-dish
on the hearth.</p>

<p>"What has grandma done with the turkey
and the plum-pudding?" said Ann Mary, aloud.</p>

<p>She looked again in the pantry; then she went
down to the cellar&mdash;there seemed to be so few places in
the house in which it was reasonable to search
for a turkey and a plum-pudding!</p>

<p>Finally she gave it up, and sat down to dinner.
There was plenty of squash and potatoes and
turnips and onions and beets and cranberry-sauce
and pies; but it was no Thanksgiving dinner
without turkey and plum-pudding. It was
like a great flourish of accompaniment without
any song.</p>

<p>Ann Mary did as well as she could; she put
some turkey-gravy on her potato and filled up
her plate with vegetables; but she did not enjoy
the dinner. She felt more and more lonely, too.
She resolved that after she had washed up the
dinner dishes and changed her dress, she would
go over to Loretta Adams's. It was quite a
piece of work, washing the dinner dishes, there
were so many pans and kettles; it was the middle
of the afternoon when she finished. Then
Ann Mary put on her best plaid dress, and
tied her best red ribbons on her braids, and
it was four o'clock before she started for Loretta's.</p>

<p>Loretta lived in a white cottage about half a
mile away towards the village. The front yard
had many bushes in it, and the front path was
bordered with box; the bushes were now mounds
of snow, and the box was indicated by two
snowy ridges.</p>

<p>The house had a shut-up look; the sitting-room
curtains were down. Ann Mary went
around to the side door; but it was locked.
Then she went up the front walk between the
snowy ridges of box, and tried the front door;
that also was locked. The Adamses had gone
away. Ann Mary did not know what to do.
The tears stood in her eyes, and she choked a
little. She went back and forth between the
two doors, and shook and pounded; she peeked
around the corner of the curtain into the sitting-room.
She could see Loretta's organ, with the
music-book, and all the familiar furniture, but
the room wore an utterly deserted air.</p>

<p>Finally, Ann Mary sat down on the front door-step,
after she had brushed off the snow a little.
She had made up her mind to wait a little while,
and see if the folks would not come home. She
had on her red hood, and her grandmother's old
plaid shawl. She pulled the shawl tightly around
her, and muffled her face in it; it was extremely
cold weather for sitting on a door-step. Just
across the road was a low clump of birches;
through and above the birches the sky showed
red and clear where the sun was setting. Everything
looked cold and bare and desolate to the
little girl who was trying to keep Thanksgiving.
Suddenly she heard a little cry, and Loretta's
white cat came around the corner of the house.</p>

<p>"Kitty, kitty, kitty," called Ann Mary. She
was very fond of Loretta's cat; she had none of
her own.</p>

<p>The cat came close and brushed around Ann
Mary so she took it up in her lap; and wrapped
the shawl around it, and felt a little comforted.</p>

<p>She sat there on the door-step and held the cat
until it was quite dusky, and she was very stiff
with the cold. Then she put down the cat and
prepared to go home. But she had not gone far
along the road when she found out that the cat
was following her. The little white creature
floundered through the snow at her heels, and
mewed constantly. Sometimes it darted ahead
and waited until she came up, but it did not
seem willing to be carried in her arms.</p>

<p>When Ann Mary reached her own house the
lonesome look of it sent a chill all over her; she
was afraid to go in. She made up her mind to
go down to Sarah Bean's and ask whether she
could not stay all night there.</p>

<p>So she kept on, and Loretta's white cat still
followed her. There was no light in Sarah
Bean's house. Ann Mary knocked and pounded,
but it was of no use; the old woman had gone
to bed, and she could not make her hear.</p>

<p>Ann Mary turned about and went home; the
tears were running down her cold red cheeks.
The cat mewed louder than ever. When she
got home she took the cat up and carried it into
the house. She determined to keep it for company,
anyway. She was sure, now, that she
would have to stay alone all night; the Adamses
and Sarah Bean were the only neighbors, and it
was so late now that she had no hope of her
grandparents' return. Ann Mary was timid and
nervous, but she had a vein of philosophy, and
she generally grasped the situation with all the
strength she had, when she became convinced
that she must. She had laid her plans while
walking home through the keen winter air, even
as the tears were streaming over her cheeks, and
she proceeded to carry them into execution. She
gave Loretta's cat its supper, and she ate a piece
of mince-pie herself; then she fixed the kitchen
and the sitting-room fires, and locked up the
house very thoroughly. Next, she took the cat
and the lamp and went into the dark bedroom
and locked the door; then she and the cat were
as safe as she knew how to make them. The
dark bedroom was in the very middle of the
house, the centre of a nest of rooms. It was
small and square, had no windows, and only one
door. It was a sort of fastness. Ann Mary made
up her mind that she would not undress herself,
and that she would keep the lamp burning all
night. She climbed into the big yellow-posted
bedstead, and the cat cuddled up to her and
purred.</p>

<p>Ann Mary lay in bed and stared at the white
satin scrolls on the wall-paper, and listened for
noises. She heard a great many, but they were
all mysterious and indefinable, till about ten
o'clock. Then she sat straight up in bed and her
heart beat fast. She certainly heard sleigh-bells;
the sound penetrated even to the dark bedroom.
Then came a jarring pounding on the side door.
Ann Mary got up, unfastened the bedroom door,
took the lamp, and stepped out into the sitting-room.
The pounding came again. "Ann Mary,
Ann Mary!" cried a voice. It was her grandmother's.</p>

<p>"I'm comin', I'm comin', grandma!" shouted
Ann Mary. She had never felt so happy in her
life. She pushed back the bolt of the side
door with trembling haste. There stood her
grandmother all muffled up, with a shawl over
her head; and out in the yard were her
grandfather and another man, with a horse
and sleigh. The men were turning the sleigh
around.</p>

<p>"Put the lamp in the window, Ann Mary,"
called Mr. Little, and Ann Mary obeyed. Her
grandmother sank into a chair. "I'm jest about
tuckered out," she groaned. "If I don't ketch
my death with this day's work, I'm lucky. There
ain't any more feelin' in my feet than as if they
was lumps of stone."</p>

<p>Ann Mary stood at her grandmother's elbow,
and her face was all beaming. "I thought you
weren't coming," said she.</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't have come a step to-night,
if it hadn't been for you&mdash;and the cow," said her
grandmother, in an indignant voice. "I was
kind of uneasy about you, an' we knew the cow
wouldn't be milked unless you got Mr. Adams to
come over."</p>

<p>"Was Aunt Betsey very sick?" inquired Ann
Mary.</p>

<p>Her grandmother gave her head a toss. "Sick!
No, there wa'n't a thing the matter with her, except
she ate some sassage-meat, an' had a little
faint turn. Lizz was scart to death, the way she
always is. She didn't act as if she knew whether
her head was on, all the time we were there.
She didn't act as if she knew 'twas Thanksgivin'
Day; an' she didn't have no turkey that I could
see. Aunt Betsey bein' took sick seemed to put
everythin' out of her head. I never saw such a
nervous thing as she is. I was all out of patience
when I got there. Betsey didn't seem to be
very bad off, an' there we'd hurried enough to
break our necks. We didn't dare to drive around
to Sarah Bean's to let you know about it, for we
was afraid we'd miss the train. We jest got in
with the man that brought the word, an' he
driv as fast as he could over to the village, an'
then we lost the train, an' had to sit there in the
depot two mortal hours. An' now we've come
fourteen mile' in an open sleigh. The man that
lives next door to Betsey said he'd bring us
home, an' I thought we'd better come. He's
goin' over to the village to-night; he's got folks
there. I told him he'd a good deal better stay
here, but he won't. He's as deaf as an adder,
an' you can't make him hear anythin', anyway.
We ain't spoke a word all the way home.
Where's Loretty? She came over to stay with
you, didn't she?"</p>

<p>Ann Mary explained that Loretta was not at
home.</p>

<p>"That's queer, seems to me, Thanksgivin'
Day," said her grandmother. "Massy sakes,
what cat's that? She came out of the settin'-room!"</p>

<p>Ann Mary explained about Loretta's cat. Then
she burst forth with the question that had been
uppermost in her mind ever since her grandmother
came in. "Grandma," said she, "what
did you do with the turkey and the plum-pudding?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"What did you do with the turkey and the
plum-pudding?"</p>

<p>"The turkey an' the plum-puddin'?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I couldn't find 'em anywhere."</p>

<p>Mrs. Little, who had removed her wraps, and
was crouching over the kitchen stove with her
feet in the oven, looked at Ann Mary with a
dazed expression.</p>

<p>"I dunno what you mean, child," said she.</p>

<p>Mr. Little had helped the man with the sleigh
to start, and had now come in. He was pulling
off his boots.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember, mother," said he,
"how you run back in the house, an' said you
was goin' to set that turkey an' plum-pudding
away, for you was afraid to leave 'em settin'
right out in plain sight on the table, for fear that
somebody might come in?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I do remember," said Mrs. Little. "I
thought they looked 'most too temptin'. I set
'em in the pantry. I thought Ann Mary could
get 'em when she came in."</p>

<p>"They ain't in the pantry," said Ann Mary.</p>

<p>Her grandmother arose and went into the
pantry with a masterful air. "Ain't in the pantry?"
she repeated. "I don't s'pose you more'n
gave one look."</p>

<p>Ann Mary followed her grandmother. She
fairly expected to see the turkey and pudding
before her eyes on the shelf and to admit that
she had been mistaken. Mr. Little also followed,
and they all stood in the pantry and looked about.</p>

<p>"I guess they ain't here, mother," said Mr.
Little. "Can't you think where you set 'em?"</p>

<p>The old woman took up the lamp and stepped
out of the pantry with dignity. "I've set 'em
somewhere," said she, in a curt voice, "an' I'll
find 'em in the mornin'. You don't want any
turkey or plum-puddin' to-night, neither of you!"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Little did not find the turkey and the
plum-pudding in the morning. Some days went
by, and their whereabouts was as much a mystery
as ever. Mrs. Little could not remember
where she had put them; but it had been in some
secure hiding-place, since her own wit which had
placed them there could not find it out. She was
so mortified and worried over it that she was
nearly ill. She tried to propound the theory,
and believe in it herself, that she had really set
the turkey and the pudding in the pantry, and
that they had been stolen; but she was too honest.
"I've heerd of folks puttin' things in such
safe places that they couldn't find 'em, before
now," said she; "but I never heerd of losin' a
turkey an' a plum-puddin' that way. I dunno
but I'm losin' what little wits I ever did have."
She went about with a humble and resentful air.
She promised Ann Mary that she would cook another
turkey and pudding the first of the week, if
the missing ones were not found.</p>

<p>Sunday came and they were not discovered.
It was a pleasant day, and the Littles went to
the village church. Ann Mary looked over
across the church after they were seated and saw
Loretta, with the pretty brown frizzes over her
forehead, sitting between her father and mother,
and she wondered when Loretta had come home.</p>

<p>The choir sang and the minister prayed. Suddenly
Ann Mary saw him, standing there in the
pulpit, unfold a paper. Then <i>the minister began
to read the Thanksgiving Proclamation</i>. Ann
Mary cast one queer glance at her grandmother,
who returned it with one of inexpressible dignity
and severity.</p>

<p>As soon as meeting was done, her grandmother
clutched her by the arm. "Don't you say a
word about it to anybody," she whispered. "You
mind!"</p>

<p>When they were in the sleigh going home she
charged her husband. "You mind, you keep still,
father," said she. "It'll be town-talk if you
don't."</p>

<p>The old man chuckled. "Don't you know, I
said once that I had kind of an idee that Thanksgivin'
weren't quite so early, and you shut me
up, mother," he remarked. He looked good-naturedly
malicious.</p>

<p>"Well, I dunno as it's anything so very queer,"
said Mrs. Little. "It comes a whole week later
than it did last year, and I s'posed we'd missed
hearin' the proclamation."</p>

<p>The next day a letter arrived saying that Lucy
and her father and mother were coming to spend
Thanksgiving. "I feel jest about beat," Mrs.
Little said, when she read the letter.</p>

<p>Really, she did feel about at her wit's end. The
turkey and pudding were not yet found, and she
had made up her mind that she would not dare
wait much longer without providing more. She
knew that another turkey must be procured, at
all events. However, she waited until the last
minute Wednesday afternoon, then she went to
work mixing a pudding. Mr. Little had gone to
the store for the turkey. "Sam White was over
there, an' he said he thought we was goin' right
into turkeys this year," he reported when he got
home.</p>

<p>That night the guests arrived. Thanksgiving
morning Lucy and Ann Mary and their grandfather
and Lucy's father and mother were all
going to meeting. Mrs. Little was to stay at
home and cook the dinner.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving morning Mr. Little made a fire
in the best parlor air-tight stove, and just before
they started for meeting Lucy and Ann Mary
were in the room. Lucy, in the big rocking-chair
that was opposite the sofa, was rocking to and
fro and talking. Ann Mary sat near the window.
Each of the little girls had on her coat and hat.</p>

<p>Suddenly Lucy stopped rocking and looked intently
over towards the sofa.</p>

<p>"What you lookin' at, Lucy?" asked Ann
Mary, curiously.</p>

<p>Lucy still looked. "Why&mdash;I was wondering
what was under that sofa," said she, slowly. Then
she turned to Ann Mary, and her face was quite
pale and startled&mdash;she had heard the turkey and
pudding story. "Oh, Ann Mary, it does look&mdash;like&mdash;oh&mdash;"</p>

<p>Both little girls rushed to the sofa, and threw
themselves on the floor. "Oh, oh, oh!" they
shrieked. "Grandma&mdash;mother! Come quick,
come quick!"</p>

<p>When the others came in, there sat Ann Mary
and Lucy on the floor, and between them were
the turkey and the plum-pudding, each carefully
covered with a snow-white napkin.</p>

<p>Mrs. Little was quite pale and trembling. "I
remember now," said she, faintly, "I run in here
with 'em."</p>

<p>She was so overcome that the others tried to
take it quietly and not to laugh much. But every
little while, after Lucy and Ann Mary were
seated in church, they would look at each other
and have to put their handkerchiefs to their
faces. However, Ann Mary tried hard to listen
to the sermon, and to behave well. In the
depths of her childish heart she felt grateful and
happy. There, by her side, sat her dear Lucy,
whose sweet little face peeped out from a furry
winter hat. Just across the aisle was Loretta,
who was coming in the evening, and then they
would pop corn and make nut-candy. At home
there was the beautiful new turkey and unlimited
pudding and good cheer, and all disappointment
and mystery were done away with.</p>

<p>Ann Mary felt as if all her troubles would be
followed by thanksgivings.</p>

<h2><a name="ANN_LIZYS_PATCHWORK" id="ANN_LIZYS_PATCHWORK"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">ANN LIZY'S PATCHWORK</a></h2>


<p>Ann Lizy was invited to spend the afternoon
and take tea with her friend Jane Baxter, and
she was ready to set forth about one o'clock.
That was the fashionable hour for children and
their elders to start when they were invited out
to spend the afternoon.</p>

<p>Ann Lizy had on her best muslin delaine dress,
her best embroidered pantalets, her black silk
apron, and her flat straw hat with long blue ribbon
streamers. She stood in the south room&mdash;the
sitting-room&mdash;before her grandmother, who
was putting some squares of patchwork, with
needle, thread, and scissors, into a green silk bag
embroidered with roses in bead-work.</p>

<p>"There, Ann Lizy," said her grandmother,
"you may take my bag if you are real careful of
it, and won't lose it. When you get to Jane's
you lay it on the table, and don't have it round
when you're playin' out-doors."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Ann Lizy. She was looking
with radiant, admiring eyes at the bag&mdash;its
cluster of cunningly wrought pink roses upon the
glossy green field of silk. Still there was a serious
droop to her mouth; she knew there was a
bitter to this sweet.</p>

<p>"Now," said her grandmother, "I've put four
squares of patchwork in the bag; they're all cut
and basted nice, and you must sew 'em all, over
and over, before you play any. Sew 'em real
fine and even, or you'll have to pick the stitches
out when you get home."</p>

<p>Ann Lizy's radiant eyes faded; she hung her
head. She calculated swiftly that she could not
finish the patchwork before four o'clock, and
that would leave her only an hour and a half to
eat supper and play with Jane, for she would
have to come home at half-past five. "Can't I
take two, and do the other two to-morrow, grandma?"
said she.</p>

<p>Her grandmother straightened herself disapprovingly.
She was a tall, wiry old woman with
strong, handsome features showing through her
wrinkles. She had been so energetic all her life,
and done so much work, that her estimation of
it was worn, like scales. Four squares of patchwork
sewed with very fine even stitches had, to
her, no weight at all; it did not seem like work.</p>

<p>"Well, if a great girl like you can't sew four
squares of patchwork in an arternoon, I wouldn't
tell of it, Ann Lizy," said she. "I don't know
what you'd say if you had to work the way I did
at your age. If you can't have time enough to
play and do a little thing like that, you'd better
stay at home. I ain't goin' to have you idle a
whole arternoon, if I know it. Time's worth
too much to be wasted that way."</p>

<p>"I'd sew the others to-morrow," pleaded Ann
Lizy, faintly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you wouldn't do it half so easy to-morrow;
you've got to pick the currants for the jell'
to-morrow. Besides, that doesn't make any difference.
To-day's work is to-day's work, and it
hasn't anything to do with to-morrow's. It's no
excuse for idlin' one day, because you do work
the next. You take that patchwork, and sit
right down and sew it as soon as you get there&mdash;don't
put it off&mdash;and sew it nice, too, or you
can stay at home&mdash;just which you like."</p>

<p>Ann Lizy sighed, but reached out her hand for
the bag. "Now be careful and not lose it," said
her grandmother, "and be a good girl."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Don't run too hard, nor go to climbin' walls,
and get your best dress torn."</p>

<p>"No, ma'am."</p>

<p>"And only one piece of cake at tea-time."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"And start for home at half-past five."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>Little Ann Lizy Jennings, as she went down
the walk between the rows of pinks, had a bewildered
feeling that she had been to Jane Baxter's
to tea, and was home again.</p>

<p>Her parents were dead, and she lived with her
Grandmother Jennings, who made her childhood
comfortable and happy, except that at times she
seemed taken off her childish feet by the energy
and strong mind of the old woman, and so swung
a little way through the world in her wake.
But Ann Lizy received no harm by it.</p>

<p>Ann Lizy went down the road with the bead
bag on her arm. She toed out primly, for she
had on her best shoes. A little girl, whom she
knew, stood at the gate in every-day clothes, and
Ann Lizy bowed to her in the way she had seen
the parson's wife bow, when out making calls in
her best black silk and worked lace veil. The
parson's wife was young and pretty, and Ann
Lizy admired her. It was quite a long walk to
Jane Baxter's, but it was a beautiful afternoon,
and the road was pleasant, although there were
not many houses. There were green fields and
flowering bushes at the sides, and, some of the
way, elm-trees arching over it. Ann Lizy would
have been very happy had it not been for the
patchwork. She had already pieced one patchwork
quilt, and her grandmother displayed it to
people with pride, saying, "Ann Lizy pieced that
before she was eight years old."</p>

<p>Ann Lizy had not as much ambition as her
grandmother, now she was engaged upon her
second quilt, and it looked to her like a checked
and besprigged calico mountain. She kept dwelling
upon those four squares, over and over, until
she felt as if each side were as long as the
Green Mountains. She calculated again and
again how little time she would have to play
with Jane&mdash;only about an hour, for she must
allow a half-hour for tea. She was not a swift
sewer when she sewed fine and even stitches,
and she knew she could not finish those squares
before four o'clock. One hour!&mdash;and she and
Jane wanted to play dolls, and make wreaths
out of oak-leaves, and go down in the lane
after thimbleberries, and in the garden for
gooseberries&mdash;there would be no time for anything!</p>

<p>Ann Lizy's delicate little face under the straw
flat grew more and more sulky and distressed,
her forehead wrinkled, and her mouth pouted.
She forgot to swing her muslin delaine skirts
gracefully, and flounced along hitting the dusty
meadowsweet bushes.</p>

<p>Ann Lizy was about half-way to Jane Baxter's
house, in a lonely part of the road, when she
opened her bead bag and drew out her pocket-handkerchief&mdash;her
grandmother had tucked that
in with the patchwork&mdash;and wiped her eyes.
When she replaced the handkerchief she put it
under the patchwork, and did not draw up the
bag again, but went on, swinging it violently by
one string.</p>

<p>When Ann Lizy reached Jane Baxter's gate
she gave a quick, scared glance at the bag. It
looked very flat and limp. She did not open it,
and she said nothing about it to Jane. They
went out to play in the garden. There were so
many hollyhocks there that it seemed like a real
flower-grove, and the gooseberries were ripe.</p>

<p>Shortly after Ann Lizy entered Jane Baxter's
house a white horse and a chaise passed down
the road in the direction from which she had
just come. There were three persons in the
chaise&mdash;a gentleman, lady, and little girl. The
lady wore a green silk pelerine, and a green
bonnet with pink strings, and the gentleman a
blue coat and bell hat. The little girl had pretty
long, light curls, and wore a white dress and
blue sash. She sat on a little footstool down in
front of the seat. They were the parson's wife's
sister, her husband, and her little girl, and had
been to visit at the parsonage. The gentleman
drove the white horse down the road, and the
little girl looked sharply and happily at everything
by the way. All at once she gave a little
cry&mdash;"Oh, father, what's that in the road?"</p>

<p>She saw Ann Lizy's patchwork, all four squares
nicely pinned together, lying beside the meadowsweet
bushes. Her father stopped the horse, got
out, and picked up the patchwork.</p>

<p>"Why," said the parson's wife's sister, "some
little girl has lost her patchwork; look, Sally!"</p>

<p>"She'll be sorry, won't she?" said the little
girl, whose name was Sally.</p>

<p>The gentleman got back into the chaise, and
the three rode off with the patchwork. There
seemed to be nothing else to do; there were no
houses near and no people of whom to inquire.
Besides, four squares of calico patchwork were
not especially valuable.</p>

<p>"If we don't find out who lost it, I'll put it
into my quilt," said Sally. She studied the patterns
of the calico very happily, as they rode
along; she thought them prettier than anything
she had. One had pink roses on a green ground,
and she thought that especially charming.</p>

<p>Meantime, while Sally and her father and
mother rode away in the chaise with the patchwork
to Whitefield, ten miles distant, where their
house was, Ann Lizy and Jane played as fast as
they could. It was four o'clock before they went
into the house. Ann Lizy opened her bag, which
she had laid on the parlor table with the <i>Young
Lady's Annuals</i> and <i>Mrs. Hemans's Poems</i>. "I
s'pose I must sew my patchwork," said she, in a
miserable, guilty little voice. Then she exclaimed.
It was strange that, well as she knew there was
no patchwork there, the actual discovery of
nothing at all gave her a shock.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Jane.</p>

<p>"I've&mdash;lost my patchwork," said Ann Lizy.</p>

<p>Jane called her mother, and they condoled
with Ann Lizy. Ann Lizy sat in one of Mrs.
Baxter's rush-bottomed chairs and began to cry.</p>

<p>"Where did you lose it?" Mrs. Baxter asked.
"Don't cry, Ann Lizy, maybe we can find it."</p>

<p>"I s'pose I&mdash;lost it comin'," sobbed Ann Lizy.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you what 't is," said Mrs. Baxter;
"you and Jane had better run up the road
a piece, and likely as not you'll find it; and I'll
have tea all ready when you come home. Don't
feel so bad, child, you'll find it, right where you
dropped it."</p>

<p>But Ann Lizy and Jane, searching carefully
along the road, did not find the patchwork where
it had been dropped. "Maybe it's blown away,"
suggested Jane, although there was hardly wind
enough that afternoon to stir a feather. And
the two little girls climbed over the stone-walls
and searched in the fields, but they did not find
the patchwork. Then another mishap befell
Ann Lizy. She tore a three-cornered place in
her best muslin delaine, getting over the wall.
When she saw that she felt as if she were in a
dreadful dream. "Oh, what will grandma say!"
she wailed.</p>

<p>"Maybe she won't scold," said Jane, consolingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, she will. Oh dear!"</p>

<p>The two little girls went dolefully home to tea.
There were hot biscuits and honey and tarts
and short gingerbread and custards, but Ann
Lizy did not feel hungry. Mrs. Baxter tried to
comfort her; she really saw not much to mourn
over, except the rent in the best dress, as four
squares of patchwork could easily be replaced;
she did not see the true inwardness of the case.</p>

<p>At half-past five, Ann Lizy, miserable and tear-stained,
the three-cornered rent in her best dress
pinned up, started for home, and then&mdash;her grandmother's
beautiful bead bag was not to be found.
Ann Lizy and Jane both remembered that it had
been carried when they set out to find the patchwork.
Ann Lizy had meditated bringing the
patchwork home in it.</p>

<p>"Aunt Cynthy made that bag for grandma,"
said Ann Lizy, in a tone of dull despair; this
was beyond tears.</p>

<p>"Well, Jane shall go with you, and help find
it," said Mrs. Baxter, "and I'll leave the tea-dishes
and go too. Don't feel so bad, Ann Lizy,
I know I can find it."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Baxter and Jane and Ann Lizy, all
searching, could not find the bead bag. "My
best handkerchief was in it," said Ann Lizy. It
seemed to her as if all her best things were gone.
She and Mrs. Baxter and Jane made a doleful
little group in the road. The frogs were peeping,
and the cows were coming home. Mrs. Baxter
asked the boy who drove the cows if he had seen
a green bead bag, or four squares of patchwork;
he stared and shook his head.</p>

<p>Ann Lizy looked like a wilted meadow reed,
the blue streamers on her hat drooped dejectedly,
her best shoes were all dusty, and the three-cornered
rent was the feature of her best muslin delaine
dress that one saw first. Then her little
delicate face was all tear-stains and downward
curves. She stood there in the road as if she
had not courage to stir.</p>

<p>"Now, Ann Lizy," said Mrs. Baxter, "you'd
better run right home and not worry. I don't
believe your grandma 'll scold you when you
tell her just how 't was."</p>

<p>Ann Lizy shook her head. "Yes, she will."</p>

<p>"Well, she'll be worrying about you if you
ain't home before long, and I guess you'd better
go," said Mrs. Baxter.</p>

<p>Ann Lizy said not another word; she began
to move dejectedly towards home. Jane and
her mother called many kindly words after her,
but she did not heed them. She kept straight
on, walking slowly until she was home. Her
grandmother stood in the doorway watching for
her. She had a blue-yarn stocking in her hands,
and she was knitting fast as she watched.</p>

<p>"Ann Lizy, where have you been, late as this?"
she called out, as Ann Lizy came up the walk.
"It's arter six o'clock."</p>

<p>Ann Lizy continued to drag herself slowly forward,
but she made no reply.</p>

<p>"Why don't you speak?"</p>

<p>Ann Lizy crooked her arm around her face
and began to cry. Her grandmother reached
down, took her by the shoulder, and led her into
the house. "What on airth is the matter, child?"
said she; "have you fell down?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am."</p>

<p>"What does ail you, then? Ann Lizy Jennings,
how come that great three-cornered tear
in your best dress?"</p>

<p>Ann Lizy sobbed.</p>

<p>"Answer me."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;tore it gittin' over&mdash;the wall."</p>

<p>"What were you gettin' over walls for in your
best dress? I'd like to know what you s'pose
you'll have to wear to meetin' now. Didn't I
tell you not to get over walls in your best dress?
<i>Ann Lizy Jennings, where is my bead bag?</i>"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;lost it."</p>

<p>"Lost my bead bag?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"How did you lose it, eh?"</p>

<p>"I lost it when&mdash;I was lookin' for&mdash;my patchwork."</p>

<p>"Did you lose your patchwork?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"When I was&mdash;goin' over to&mdash;Jane's."</p>

<p>"Lost it out of the bag?"</p>

<p>Ann Lizy nodded, sobbing.</p>

<p>"Then you went to look for it and lost the
bag. Lost your best pocket-handkerchief, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Jennings stood looking at Ann Lizy.</p>

<p>"All that patchwork, cut out and basted jest
as nice as could be, your best pocket-handkerchief
and my bead bag lost, and your meetin'
dress tore," said she; "well, you've done about
enough for one day. Take off your things and
go up-stairs to bed. You can't go over to Jane
Baxter's again for one spell, and every mite of
the patchwork that goes into the quilt you've
got to cut by a thread, and baste yourself, and
to-morrow you've got to hunt for that patchwork
and that bag till you find 'em, if it takes
you all day. Go right along."</p>

<p>Ann Lizy took off her hat and climbed meekly
up-stairs and went to bed. She did not say her
prayers; she lay there and wept. It was about
half-past eight, the air coming through the open
window was loud with frogs and katydids and
whippoorwills, and the twilight was very deep,
when Ann Lizy arose and crept down-stairs. She
could barely see her way.</p>

<p>There was a candle lighted in the south room,
and her grandmother sat there knitting. Ann
Lizy, a piteous little figure in her white night-gown,
stood in the door.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" her grandmother said, in
a severe voice that had a kindly inflection in it.</p>

<p>"Grandma&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I lost my patchwork on purpose. I didn't
want&mdash;to sew it."</p>

<p>"Lost your patchwork on purpose!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;ma'am," sobbed Ann Lizy.</p>

<p>"Let it drop out of the bag on purpose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Well, you did a dreadful wicked thing then.
Go right back to bed."</p>

<p>Ann Lizy went back to bed and to sleep. Remorse
no longer gnawed keenly enough at her
clear, childish conscience to keep her awake, now
her sin was confessed. She said her prayers and
went to sleep. Although the next morning the
reckoning came, the very worst punishment was
over for her. Her grandmother held the judicious
use of the rod to be a part of her duty towards
her beloved little orphan granddaughter,
so she switched Ann Lizy with a little rod of
birch, and sent her forth full of salutary tinglings
to search for the bead bag and the patchwork.
All the next week Ann Lizy searched the fields
and road for the missing articles, when she was
not cutting calico patchwork by a thread and
sewing over and over. It seemed to her that
life was made up of those two occupations, but
at the end of a week the search, so far as the
bead bag was concerned, came to an end.</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoon the parson's wife
called on old Mrs. Jennings. The sweet, gentle
young lady in her black silk dress, her pink
cheeks, and smooth waves of golden hair gleaming
through her worked lace veil entered the
north room, which was the parlor, and sat down
in the rocking-chair. Ann Lizy and her grandmother
sat opposite, and they both noticed at the
same moment that the parson's wife held in her
hand&mdash;<i>the bead bag</i>!</p>

<p>Ann Lizy gave a little involuntary "oh;" her
grandmother shook her head fiercely at her, and
the parson's wife noticed nothing. She went on
talking about the pinks out in the yard, in her
lovely low voice.</p>

<p>As soon as she could, old Mrs. Jennings excused
herself and beckoned Ann Lizy to follow
her out of the room. Then, while she was arranging
a square of pound-cake and a little glass
of elderberry wine on a tray, she charged Ann
Lizy to say nothing about the bead bag to the
parson's wife. "Mind you act as if you didn't
see it," said she; "don't sit there lookin' at it
that way."</p>

<p>"But it's your bead bag, grandma," said Ann
Lizy, in a bewildered way.</p>

<p>"Don't you say anything," admonished her
grandmother. "Now carry this tray in, and be
careful you don't spill the elderberry wine."</p>

<p>Poor Ann Lizy tried her best not to look at
the bead bag, while the parson's wife ate pound-cake,
sipped the elderberry wine, and conversed
in her sweet, gracious way; but it did seem
finally to her as if it were the bead bag instead
of the parson's wife that was making the call.
She kept wondering if the parson's wife would
not say, "Mrs. Jennings, is this your bead bag?"
but she did not. She made the call and took
leave, and the bead bag was never mentioned.
It was odd, too, that it was not; for the parson's
wife, who had found the bead bag, had taken it
with her on her round of calls that afternoon,
partly to show it and find out, if she could, who
had lost it. But here it was driven out of her
mind by the pound-cake and elderberry wine, or
else she did not think it likely that an old
lady like Mrs. Jennings could have owned the
bag. Younger ladies than she usually carried
them. However it was, she went away with the
bag.</p>

<p>"Why didn't she ask if it was yours?" inquired
Ann Lizy, indignant in spite of her admiration
for the parson's wife.</p>

<p>"Hush," said her grandmother. "You mind
you don't say a word out about this, Ann Lizy.
I ain't never carried it, and she didn't suspect."</p>

<p>Now, the bead bag was found after this unsatisfactory
fashion; but Ann Lizy never went
down the road without looking for the patchwork.
She never dreamed how little Sally Putnam,
the minister's wife's niece, was in the mean-time
sewing these four squares over and over,
getting them ready to go into her quilt. It was
a month later before she found it out, and it was
strange that she discovered it at all.</p>

<p>It so happened that, one afternoon in the last
of August, old Mrs. Jennings dressed herself in
her best black bombazine, her best bonnet and
mantilla and mitts, and also dressed Ann Lizy
in her best muslin delaine, exquisitely mended,
and set out to make a call on the parson's wife.
When they arrived they found a chaise and
white horse out in the parsonage yard, and the
parson's wife's sister and family there on a visit.
An old lady, Mrs. White, a friend of Mrs. Jennings,
was also making a call.</p>

<p>Little Ann Lizy and Sally Putnam were introduced
to each other, and Ann Lizy looked admiringly
at Sally's long curls and low-necked
dress, which had gold catches in the sleeves.
They sat and smiled shyly at each other.</p>

<p>"Show Ann Lizy your patchwork, Sally," the
parson's wife said, presently. "Sally has got
almost enough patchwork for a quilt, and she
has brought it over to show me," she added.</p>

<p>Ann Lizy colored to her little slender neck;
patchwork was nowadays a sore subject with her,
but she looked on as Sally, proud and smiling,
displayed her patchwork.</p>

<p>Suddenly she gave a little cry. There was one
of her squares! The calico with roses on a green
ground was in Sally's patchwork.</p>

<p>Her grandmother shook her head energetically
at her, but old Mrs. White had on her spectacles,
and she, too, had spied the square.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Jennings," she cried, "that's jest
like that dress you had so long ago!"</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Sally's mother, quickly.
"Why, yes; that is the very square you found,
Sally. That is one; there were four of them,
all cut and basted. Why, this little girl didn't
lose them, did she?"</p>

<p>Then it all came out. The parson's wife was
quick-witted, and she thought of the bead bag.
Old Mrs. Jennings was polite, and said it did not
matter; but when she and Ann Lizy went home
they had the bead bag, with the patchwork and
the best pocket-handkerchief in it.</p>

<p>It had been urged that little Sally Putnam
should keep the patchwork, since she had sewed
it, but her mother was not willing.</p>

<p>"No," said she, "this poor little girl lost it,
and Sally mustn't keep it; it wouldn't be
right."</p>

<p>Suddenly Ann Lizy straightened herself. Her
cheeks were blazing red, but her black eyes were
brave.</p>

<p>"I lost that patchwork on purpose," said she.
"I didn't want to sew it. Then I lost the bag
while I was lookin' for it."</p>

<p>There was silence for a minute.</p>

<p>"You are a good girl to tell of it," said Sally's
mother, finally.</p>

<p>Ann Lizy's grandmother shook her head meaningly
at Mrs. Putnam.</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said she. "Ownin'-up
takes away <i>some</i> of the sin, but it don't
<i>all</i>."</p>

<p>But when she and Ann Lizy were on their
homeward road she kept glancing down at her
granddaughter's small face. It struck her that
it was not so plump and rosy as it had been.</p>

<p>"I think you've had quite a lesson by this
time about that patchwork," she remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Ann Lizy.</p>

<p>They walked a little farther. The golden-rod
and the asters were in blossom now, and the
road was bordered with waving fringes of blue
and gold. They came in sight of Jane Baxter's
house.</p>

<p>"You may stop in Jane Baxter's, if you want
to," said old Mrs. Jennings, "and ask her mother
if she can come over and spend the day with you
to-morrow. And tell her I say she'd better not
bring her sewing, and she'd better not wear her
best dress, for you and she ain't goin' to sew
any, and mebbe you'll like to go berryin', and
play out-doors."</p>

<p>"And you must spin faster, Dorothy, or you'll
go to bed without your supper," said Dame Betsy.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," replied Dorothy. Then she
twirled the wheel so fast that the spokes were
a blur.</p>

<p>Dorothy was a pretty little girl. She had a
small pink-and-white face; her hair was closely
cropped and looked like a little golden cap, and
her eyes were as blue as had been the flowers of
the flax which she was spinning. She wore an
indigo-blue frock, and she looked very short and
slight beside the wheel.</p>

<p>Dorothy spun, Dame Betsy tended a stew-kettle
that was hanging from the crane in the fire-place,
and the eldest of Dame Betsy's six daughters
sat on the bench beside the cottage door and
ate honey-cakes. The other daughters had arrayed
themselves in their best tuckers and
plumed hats and farthingales, spread their ruffled
parasols, and gone to walk.</p>

<p>Dame Betsy had wished the oldest daughter
to go with her sisters; but she was rather indolent,
so she dressed herself in her best, and sat
down on the bench beside the door, with a plate
of honey-cakes of which she was very fond. She
held up her parasol to shield her face, and also
to display the parasol. It was covered with very
bright green satin, and had a wreath of pink roses
for a border. The sun shone directly into the
cottage, and the row of pewter plates on the
dresser glittered; one could see them through
the doorway. The front yard of Dame Betsy's
cottage was like a little grove with lemon-color
and pink hollyhocks; one had to look directly
up the path to see the eldest daughter sitting on
the bench eating honey-cakes. She was a very
homely girl. All Dame Betsy's daughters were
so plain and ill-tempered that they had no suitors,
although they walked abroad every day.</p>

<p>Dame Betsy placed her whole dependence upon
the linen chests when she planned to marry her
daughters. At the right of her cottage stretched
a great field of flax that looked now like a blue
sea, and it rippled like a sea when the wind
struck it. Dame Betsy and Dorothy made the
flax into linen for the daughters' dowries. They
had already two great chests of linen apiece, and
they were to have chests filled until there were
enough to attract suitors. Every little while
Dame Betsy invited all the neighboring housewives
to tea; then she opened the chests and unrolled
the shining lengths of linen, perfumed with
lavender and rosemary. "My dear daughters
will have all this, and more also, when they
marry," she would remark. The housewives
would go home and mention it to their sons, for
they themselves were tempted by the beautiful
linen; but there it would end. The sons would
not go to woo Dame Betsy's homely, ill-natured
daughters.</p>

<p>Dorothy spun as fast as she was able; Dame
Betsy kept a sharp watch upon her as she stirred
the stew. Dorothy wanted some of the stew for
her supper. It had a delicious odor, and she was
very faint and hungry. She did not have a great
deal to eat at any time, as she lived principally
upon the scraps from the table, and the daughters
were all large eaters. She also worked very
hard, and never had any time to play. She was
a poor child whom Dame Betsy had taken from
the almshouse, and she had no relatives but an
old grandmother. She had very few kind words
said to her during the day, and she used often to
cry herself to sleep at night.</p>

<p>Presently Dame Betsy went down to the store
to buy some pepper to put in the stew, but as
she went out of the door she spoke to the eldest
daughter, and told her to go into the house and
mend a rent in her apron. "Since you were too
lazy to go to walk with your sisters you must go
into the house and mend your apron," said she.
The eldest daughter pouted, but she made no reply.
Just as soon as her mother was out of hearing
she called Dorothy. "Dorothy, come here
a minute!" she cried, imperatively. Dorothy
left her wheel and went to the door. "Look
here," said the eldest daughter, "I have one
honey-cake left, and I have eaten all I want. I
will give you this if you will mend my apron
for me."</p>

<p>Dorothy eyed the honey-cake wistfully, but
she replied that she did not dare to leave her
spinning to mend the apron.</p>

<p>"Why can't you mend it in the night?" asked
the eldest daughter.</p>

<p>"I will do that," replied Dorothy, eagerly, and
she held out her hand for the honey-cake. Just
as she did so she saw the little boy that lived
next door peeping through his fence. His beautiful
little face, with his red cheeks and black
eyes, looked, through the pickets, like a damask-rose.
Dorothy ran swiftly over to him with her
honey-cake. "You shall have half of it," said
she, and she quickly broke the cake in halves,
and gave one of them to the little boy. He
lived with his old grandmother, and they were
very poor; it was hard for them to get the
coarsest porridge to eat. The little boy often
stood looking through the fence and smiling at
Dorothy, and the old grandmother spoke kindly
to her whenever she had an opportunity.</p>

<p>The little boy stood on one side of the fence
and Dorothy on the other, and they ate the
honey-cake. Then Dorothy ran back to the
house and fell to spinning again. She spun so
fast, to make up for the lost time, that one could
not see the wheel-spokes at all, and the room
hummed like a hive of bees. But, fast as she
spun, Dame Betsy, when she returned, discovered
that she had been idling, and said that she must
go without her supper. Poor Dorothy could not
help weeping as she twirled the wheel, she was
so hungry, and the honey-cake had been very
small.</p>

<p>Dame Betsy dished up the stew and put the
spoons and bowls on the table, and soon the five
absent daughters came home, rustling their
flounces and flirting their parasols.</p>

<p>They all sat down to the table and began to
eat, while Dorothy stood at her wheel and sadly
spun.</p>

<p>They had eaten all the stew except a little,
just about enough for a cat, when a little shadow
fell across the floor.</p>

<p>"Why, who's coming?" whispered Dame Betsy,
and directly all the daughters began to smooth
their front hair; each thought it might be a
suitor.</p>

<p>But everything that they could see entering
the door was a beautiful gray cat. She came stepping
across the floor with a dainty, velvet tread.
She had a tail like a plume, and she trailed it
on the floor as she walked; her fur was very soft
and long, and caught the light like silver; she
had delicate tufted ears, and her shining eyes
were like yellow jewels.</p>

<p>"It's nothing but a cat!" cried the daughters
in disgust, and Dame Betsy arose to get the
broom; she hated cats. That decided the daughters;
they also hated cats, but they liked to oppose
their mother. So they insisted on keeping
the cat.</p>

<p>There was much wrangling, but the daughters
were too much for Dame Betsy; the beautiful
cat was allowed to remain on the hearth, and the
remnant of the stew was set down there for her.
But, to every one's amazement, she refused to
touch it. She sat purring, with her little silvery
paws folded, her plumy tail swept gracefully
around her, and quite ignored the stew.</p>

<p>"I will take it up and give it to the pig," said
Dame Betsy.</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried the daughters; "leave it, and
perhaps she will eat it by-and-by."</p>

<p>So the stew was left upon the hearth. In the
excitement Dorothy had stopped spinning, and
nobody had observed it. Suddenly Dame Betsy
noticed that the wheel was silent.</p>

<p>"Why are you not spinning, miss?" she asked,
sharply. "Are you stopping work to look at a
cat?"</p>

<p>But Dorothy made no reply; she paid no attention
whatever: she continued to stare at the
cat; she was quite pale, and her blue eyes were
very large. And no wonder, for she saw, instead
of a cat, a beautiful little princess, with eyes like
stars, in a trailing robe of gray velvet covered
with silver embroidery, and instead of a purr she
heard a softly-hummed song. Dame Betsy seized
Dorothy by the arm.</p>

<p>"To your work!" she cried.</p>

<p>And Dorothy began to spin; but she was trembling
from head to foot, and every now and then
she glanced at the princess on the hearth.</p>

<p>The daughters, in their best gowns, sat with
their mother around the hearth until nine o'clock;
then Dorothy was ordered to leave her wheel, the
cottage was locked up, and everybody went to bed.</p>

<p>Dorothy's bed was a little bundle of straw up
in the garret under the eaves. She was very
tired when she lay down, but did not dare to
sleep, for she remembered her promise to mend
the eldest daughter's apron. So she waited until
the house was still; then she arose and crept softly
down-stairs.</p>

<p>The fire on the hearth was still burning, and
there sat the princess, and the sweet hum of her
singing filled the room. But Dorothy could not
understand a word of the song, because it was in
the Persian language. She stood in the doorway
and trembled; she did not know what to do. It
seemed to her that she must be losing her wits
to see a princess where every one else saw a cat.
Still she could not doubt the evidence of her own
eyes. Finally she advanced a little way and
courtesied very low. The princess stopped
singing at once. She arose in a stately fashion,
and fastened her bright eyes upon Dorothy.</p>

<p>"So you know me?" said she.</p>

<p>Dorothy courtesied again.</p>

<p>"Are you positive that I am not a cat?"</p>

<p>Dorothy courtesied.</p>

<p>"Well, I am <i>not</i> a cat," said the princess. "I
am a true princess from Persia, travelling incognita.
You are the first person who has
pierced my disguise. You must have very extraordinary
eyes. Aren't you hungry?"</p>

<p>Dorothy courtesied.</p>

<p>"Come here and eat the stew," ordered the
princess, in a commanding tone. "Meantime I
will cook my own supper."</p>

<p>With that the princess gave a graceful leap
across the floor; her gray velvet robe fluttered
like a gray wing. Dorothy saw a little mouse
scud before her; then in an instant the princess
had him! But the moment the princess lifted
the mouse, he became a gray pigeon, all dressed
for cooking.</p>

<p>The princess sat down on the hearth and put
the pigeon on the coals to broil.</p>

<p>"You had better eat your stew," said she; "I
won't offer you any of this pigeon, because you
could not help suspecting it was mouse."</p>

<p>So Dorothy timidly took up the stew, and began
to eat it; she was in reality nearly starved.</p>

<p>"Now," said the Persian princess, when she
had finished, "you had better do that mending,
while I finish cooking and eat my own supper."</p>

<p>Dorothy obeyed. By the time the apron was
neatly mended, the princess had finished cooking
and eaten the pigeon. "Now, I wish to talk a
little to you," said she. "I feel as if you deserved
my confidence since you have penetrated my disguise.
I am a Persian princess, as I said before,
and I am travelling incognita to see the world
and improve my mind, and also to rescue my
brother, who is a Maltese prince and enchanted.
My brother, when very young, went on his travels,
was shipwrecked on the coast of Malta, and
became a prince of that island. But he had
enemies, and was enchanted. He is now a Maltese
cat. I disguise myself as a cat in order to find
him more readily. Now, for what do you most
wish?"</p>

<p>Dorothy courtesied; she was really too impressed
to speak.</p>

<p>"Answer," said the princess, imperiously.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;want," stammered Dorothy, "to&mdash;take
my grandmother out of&mdash;the almshouse, and have
her sit at the window in the sun in a cushioned
chair and knit a silk stocking all day."</p>

<p>"Anything else?"</p>

<p>"I should like to&mdash;have her wear a bombazine
gown and a&mdash;white lace cap with&mdash;lilac ribbons."</p>

<p>"You are a good girl," said the princess.
"Now, listen. I see that you are not very pleasantly
situated here, and I will teach you a way
to escape. Take your hood off that peg over
there, and come out with me. I want to find
my portmanteau that I left under the hedge, a
little way down the road."</p>

<p>Dorothy put on her hood and followed the
princess down the road. The little girl could
scarcely keep up with her; she seemed to fairly
fly through the moonlight, trailing her gray robe
after her.</p>

<p>"Here is my portmanteau," said the princess,
when they had reached the hedge. The hedge
was all white hawthorn and very sweet. The
portmanteau had lain well under it. All Dorothy
could see was a tiny leather wallet, that a
cat could carry in her mouth. But the princess
blew upon it three times, and suddenly a great
leather trunk stood on the grass. The princess
opened it, and Dorothy gave a little cry, her
eyes were so dazzled. It was like a blaze of gold
and silver and jewels. "Look at this," said the
princess. And she took out of the trunk the
splendid robe that was laid uppermost.</p>

<p>Dorothy looked; she could not say anything.
The robe was woven of silk, with gold and silver
threads, and embroidered with jewels.</p>

<p>"If you will give this to Dame Betsy for her
eldest daughter's bridal dress, she will let you
go," said the princess. She took a pair of silver
shears out of the trunk and cut off a bit of the
robe under a flounce. "Show that to Dame
Betsy," said the princess, "and tell her you will
give her the dress made of the same material,
and she will let you go. Now you had better
run home. I shall stay here and sleep under
the hedge. I do not like Dame Betsy's house.
Come here in the morning, when you have told
her about the dress."</p>

<p>The princess sat down on the trunk, and it
immediately shrunk into the little wallet; then
she curled herself up on the grass under the
flowery hedge. Dorothy ran home and crept
noiselessly up to her bed in the garret.</p>

<p>In the morning, when the daughters came down
to breakfast, they missed the cat. "Where is
the cat?" they inquired indignantly of their
mother. They suspected her of driving the cat
away with the broom. They had quite a wrangle
over it. Finally, the daughters all put on
finery and went out shopping for some needles
and pins; then Dorothy showed Dame Betsy the
scrap of the splendid robe, and said to her what
the princess had directed she should say.</p>

<p>Dame Betsy was very much surprised and disturbed.
She did not wish to lose Dorothy, who
was a great help to her; still, she had no doubt
that a suitor would soon appear for her eldest
daughter, if arrayed in so beautiful a bridal gown
as that. She reflected how she might have a
tea-party and invite all the neighbors, and display
the robe, and how all the sons would come
flocking to the door. Finally she consented, and
Dorothy, as soon as her mistress's back was
turned, ran out and away to the hedge, under
which she knew the Persian princess to be concealed.</p>

<p>The princess looked up and rubbed her eyes.
She had slept late, although the birds were singing
loudly all around her. Dorothy courtesied
and said that she had come for the robe. "Very
well," replied the princess, "I will give it to you;
then you must carry it and hang it over Dame
Betsy's gate, and run back to me as fast as you
are able."</p>

<p>Then the princess blew on the wallet until it
became a trunk, and she took out the splendid
robe and gave it to Dorothy, who carried it and
hung it over Dame Betsy's gate just as she had
been bidden. But as she was about to run away,
she saw the little boy who lived next door peeping
through his fence, so she stopped to bid him
good-bye. He felt so sad that he wept, and
Dorothy herself had tears in her eyes when she
ran to join the princess.</p>

<p>Dorothy and the princess then set off on their
travels; but nobody except Dorothy herself knew
that there was a princess. Every one who met
them saw simply a little girl and a beautiful
gray cat. Finally they stopped at a pretty little
village. "Here," said the princess, "we will rent
a cottage."</p>

<p>They looked about until they found a charming
cottage with a grape-vine over the door, and
roses and marigolds in the yard; then Dorothy,
at the princess's direction, went to the landlord
and bargained for it.</p>

<p>Then they went to live in the cottage, and the
princess taught Dorothy how to make lovely
tidies and cushions and aprons out of the beautiful
dresses in her trunk. She had a great store
of them, but they were all made in the Persian
fashion and were of no use in this country.</p>

<p>When Dorothy had made the pretty articles
out of the rich dresses, she went out and sold
them to wealthy ladies for high prices. She soon
earned quite a sum of money, which she placed
at interest in the bank, and she was then able to
take her grandmother out of the almshouse. She
bought a beautiful chair with a canary-colored
velvet cushion, and she placed it at the window
in the sun. She bought a bombazine dress and
a white cap with lilac ribbons, and she had the
silk stocking with the needles all ready.</p>

<p>But the day before the old grandmother came
the princess bade Dorothy good-bye. "I am going
out again on my travels," said she; "I wish
to see more of the country, and I must continue
my search for my brother, the Maltese
prince."</p>

<p>So the princess kissed Dorothy, who wept;
then she set forth on her travels. Dorothy gazed
sorrowfully after her as she went. She saw a
dainty little princess, trailing her gray velvets;
but everybody else saw only a lovely gray cat
hurrying down the road.</p>

<p>Dorothy's grandmother came to live with her.
She sat in her cushioned chair, in the sunny
window and knitted her silk stocking, and was
a very happy old woman. Dorothy continued to
make beautiful things out of the princess's dresses.
It seemed as if there would never be any end
to them. She had cut up many dresses, but there
were apparently as many now as when she began.
She saw no more of the princess, although
she thought of her daily, until she was quite
grown up and was a beautiful maiden with many
suitors. Then, one day, she went to the city to
deliver a beautiful cushion that she had made for
some wealthy ladies, and there, in the drawing-room,
she saw the Persian princess.</p>

<p>Dorothy was left in the room until the ladies
came down, and as she sat there holding her
cushion, she heard a little velvet rustle and a
softly-hummed song in the Persian language.
She looked, and there was the princess stepping
across the floor, trailing her gray velvets.</p>

<p>"So you have come, dear Dorothy," said the
princess.</p>

<p>Dorothy arose and courtesied, but the princess
came close and kissed her. "What have you
there?" she inquired.</p>

<p>Dorothy displayed the cushion; the princess
laughed.</p>

<p>"It is quite a joke, is it not?" said she. "That
cushion is for me to sleep on, and it is made
out of one of my own dresses. The ladies have
bought it for me. I have heard them talking
about it. How do you fare, Dorothy, and how
is your grandmother?"</p>

<p>Then Dorothy told the princess how the grandmother
sat in the cushioned chair in the sunny
window and knitted the silk stocking, and how
she herself was to be married the next week to
the little boy who had lived next door, but was
now grown up and come a-wooing.</p>

<p>"Where is his grandmother?" asked the
princess.</p>

<p>Dorothy replied that she was to live with them,
and that there was already another cushioned
chair in a sunny window, another bombazine
dress and lace cap, and a silk stocking, in readiness,
and that both grandmothers were to
sit and knit in peace during the rest of their
lives.</p>

<p>"Ah, well," said the princess, with a sigh, "if
I were only back in Persia I would buy you a
wedding present, but I do not know when that
will be&mdash;the ladies are so kind."</p>

<p>Dorothy ventured to inquire if the princess
had found her brother, the Maltese prince.</p>

<p>"Dear me, yes," replied the princess. "Why,
he lives in this very house. He is out in the
back parlor asleep on the sofa, this minute.
Brother, dear brother, come here a second, I
pray!"</p>

<p>With that a Maltese prince, with a long, aristocratic
face, and beautiful, serious eyes, entered
with a slow and stately tread. He was dressed
in gray velvet, like his sister, and he wore white
velvet mittens. Dorothy courtesied very low.</p>

<p>"Yes, I found my brother here, some time
ago," said the princess; "but I have very little
hope of freeing him from his enchantment. You
see, there is only one thing that can break the
spell: one of his mistresses must drive him out
of the house with the broom, and I do not believe
that either of them ever will&mdash;they are so
exceedingly gracious and kind. I have tried to
induce my brother to commit some little sin&mdash;to
steal some cream or some meat, or to fly around
the room as if he were in a fit (I myself have
shown him how to do that), but he will not consent.
He has too much dignity, and he is too
fond of these ladies. And, if he should, I doubt
if he would be driven out with the broom&mdash;they
are so kind."</p>

<p>The princess sighed. The prince stood looking
in a grave and stately manner at Dorothy,
but he did not speak. "However," the princess
continued, cheerfully, "we do very well here, and
in some respects this is a more enlightened country
than either Persia or Malta, and it is a privilege
to live here. The ladies are very kind to
us, and we are very fond of them; then, too, we
see very fine company. And there are also Persian
hangings and rugs which make it seem
home-like. We are very well contented. I don't
know, on the whole, that we are in any hurry to
go away. But should either of the ladies ever
take it into her head to drive my brother out of
the house with the broom, we shall at once leave
the country for Persia and Malta; for, after all,
one's native land is dear."</p>

<p>The princess stopped talking, and began to
hum her Persian song, and then the ladies entered
the room. They greeted Dorothy kindly;
then they began to call, "Vashti, Vashti, come
here, pretty Vashti," and, "Muff, Muff, come
here, pretty Muff." For they did not see the
Persian princess and the Maltese prince, but two
beautiful cats, whose names were Vashti and Muff.</p>

<p>"Just hear Vashti purr," said one of the ladies.
"Come here, pretty Vashti, and try your new
cushion."</p>

<p>And the ladies saw a cat sitting on the rich
cushion, and another cat looking at her gravely,
while Dorothy saw a Persian princess and a
Maltese prince.</p>

<p>However, the ladies knew that there was
something uncommon about their cats, and they
sometimes suspected the truth themselves, but
they thought it must be a fancy.</p>

<p>Dorothy left her cushion and went away, and
that was the last time she ever saw the Persian
princess. As she went out the door the princess
pressed close to her. The ladies thought she
mewed, but in reality she was talking.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Dorothy," said she, "I hope you
will live happily ever after. And as for my
brother and I, we really enjoy ourselves; we are
seeing the country and improving our minds, and
we love the ladies. If one of them should drive
him out with the broom, he will become a prince
again, and we shall leave; but I do not know
that it is desirable. A cat has a more peaceful
life than a prince. Good-bye, dear Dorothy."</p>

<p>The princess was going closer to embrace
Dorothy, but the ladies became alarmed; they
thought that their beautiful cat was going to
steal out of the house. So they called, and a
maid with a white cap ran and caught the Persian
princess, and carried her back to the drawing-room.
The ladies thought she mewed as she
was being carried in, but in reality she was calling
back merrily, "Good-bye, and live happily
ever after, dear Dorothy!"</p>

<h2><a name="WHERE_THE_CHRISTMAS-TREE_GREW" id="WHERE_THE_CHRISTMAS-TREE_GREW"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">WHERE THE CHRISTMAS-TREE GREW</a></h2>


<p>It was afternoon recess at No. 4 District
School, in Warner. There was a heavy snow-storm;
so every one was in the warm school-room,
except a few adventurous spirits who were
tumbling about in the snow-drifts out in the
yard, getting their clothes wet and preparing
themselves for chidings at home. Their shrill
cries and shouts of laughter floated into the
school-room, but the small group near the stove
did not heed them at all. There were five or six
little girls and one boy. The girls, with the exception
of Jenny Brown, were trim and sweet
in their winter dresses and neat school-aprons;
they perched on the desks and the arms of the
settee with careless grace, like birds. Some of
them had their arms linked. The one boy lounged
against the blackboard. His dark, straight-profiled
face was all aglow as he talked. His big
brown eyes gazed now soberly and impressively
at Jenny, then gave a gay dance in the direction
of the other girls.</p>

<p>"Yes, it does&mdash;<i>honest</i>!" said he.</p>

<p>The other girls nudged one another softly;
but Jenny Brown stood with her innocent, solemn
eyes fixed upon Earl Munroe's face, drinking
in every word.</p>

<p>"You ask anybody who knows," continued
Earl; "ask Judge Barker, ask&mdash;the minister&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried the little girls; but the boy shook
his head impatiently at them.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he; "you just go and ask Mr.
Fisher to-morrow, and you'll see what he'll tell
you. Why, look here"&mdash;Earl straightened himself
and stretched out an arm like an orator&mdash;"it's
nothing more than <i>reasonable</i> that Christmas-trees
grow wild with the presents all on 'em!
What sense would there be in 'em if they didn't,
I'd like to know? They grow in different places,
of course; but these around here grow mostly
on the mountain over there. They come up
every spring, and they all blossom out about
Christmas-time, and folks go hunting for them
to give to the children. Father and Ben are
over on the mountain to-day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" cried the little girls.</p>

<p>"I mean, I guess they are," amended Earl,
trying to put his feet on the boundary&mdash;line of
truth. "I hope they'll find a full one."</p>

<p>Jenny Brown had a little, round, simple face;
her thin brown hair was combed back and braided
tightly in one tiny braid tied with a bit of shoe-string.
She wore a nondescript gown, which
nearly trailed behind, and showed in front her
little, coarsely-shod feet, which toed-in helplessly.
The gown was of a faded green color; it was
scalloped and bound around the bottom, and had
some green ribbon-bows down the front. It
was, in fact, the discarded polonaise of a benevolent
woman, who aided the poor substantially
but not tastefully.</p>

<p>Jenny Brown was eight, and small for her age&mdash;a
strange, gentle, ignorant little creature, never
doubting the truth of what she was told, which
sorely tempted the other children to impose upon
her. Standing there in the school-room that
stormy recess, in the midst of that group of
wiser, richer, mostly older girls, and that one
handsome, mischievous boy, she believed every
word she heard.</p>

<p>This was her first term at school, and she had
never before seen much of other children. She
had lived her eight years all alone at home with
her mother, and she had never been told about
Christmas. Her mother had other things to
think about. She was a dull, spiritless, reticent
woman, who had lived through much trouble.
She worked, doing washings and cleanings, like
a poor feeble machine that still moves but has
no interest in its motion. Sometimes the Browns
had almost enough to eat, at other times they
half starved. It was half-starving time just then;
Jenny had not had enough to eat that day.</p>

<p>There was a pinched look on the little face up-turned
towards Earl Munroe's.</p>

<p>Earl's words gained authority by coming from
himself. Jenny had always regarded him with
awe and admiration. It was much that he should
speak at all to her.</p>

<p>Earl Munroe was quite the king of this little
district school. He was the son of the wealthiest
man in town. No other boy was so well dressed,
so gently bred, so luxuriously lodged and fed.
Earl himself realized his importance, and had at
times the loftiness of a young prince in his manner.
Occasionally, some independent urchin
would bristle with democratic spirit, and tell him
to his face that he was "stuck up," and that he
hadn't so much more to be proud of than other
folks; that his grandfather wasn't anything but
an old ragman!</p>

<p>Then Earl would wilt. Arrogance in a free
country is likely to have an unstable foundation.
Earl tottered at the mention of his paternal
grandfather, who had given the first impetus to
the family fortune by driving a tin-cart about
the country. Moreover, the boy was really pleasant
and generous hearted, and had no mind, in
the long run, for lonely state and disagreeable
haughtiness. He enjoyed being lordly once in a
while, that was all.</p>

<p>He did now, with Jenny&mdash;he eyed her with
a gay condescension, which would have greatly
amused his tin-peddler grandfather.</p>

<p>Soon the bell rung, and they all filed to their
seats, and the lessons were begun.</p>

<p>After school was done that night, Earl stood
in the door when Jenny passed out.</p>

<p>"Say, Jenny," he called, "when are you going
over on the mountain to find the Christmas-tree?
You'd better go pretty soon, or they'll be
gone."</p>

<p>"That's so!" chimed in one of the girls.
"You'd better go right off, Jenny."</p>

<p>She passed along, her face shyly dimpling with
her little innocent smile, and said nothing. She
would never talk much.</p>

<p>She had quite a long walk to her home. Presently,
as she was pushing weakly through the
new snow, Earl went flying past her in his
father's sleigh, with the black horses and the fur-capped
coachman. He never thought of asking
her to ride. If he had, he would not have hesitated
a second before doing so.</p>

<p>Jenny, as she waded along, could see the
mountain always before her. This road led
straight to it, then turned and wound around its
base. It had stopped snowing, and the sun was
setting clear. The great white mountain was all
rosy. It stood opposite the red western sky.
Jenny kept her eyes fixed upon the mountain.
Down in the valley shadows her little simple
face, pale and colorless, gathered another kind
of radiance.</p>

<p>There was no school the next day, which was
the one before Christmas. It was pleasant, and
not very cold. Everybody was out; the little
village stores were crowded; sleds trailing Christmas-greens
went flying; people were hastening
with parcels under their arms, their hands full.</p>

<p>Jenny Brown also was out. She was climbing
Franklin Mountain. The snowy pine boughs
bent so low that they brushed her head. She
stepped deeply into the untrodden snow; the
train of her green polonaise dipped into it, and
swept it along. And all the time she was peering
through those white fairy columns and arches
for&mdash;a Christmas-tree.</p>

<p>That night, the mountain had turned rosy, and
faded, and the stars were coming out, when a
frantic woman, panting, crying out now and then
in her distress, went running down the road to
the Munroe house. It was the only one between
her own and the mountain. The woman rained
some clattering knocks on the door&mdash;she could
not stop for the bell. Then she burst into the
house, and threw open the dining-room door,
crying out in gasps:</p>

<p>"Hev you seen her? Oh, hev you? My Jenny's
lost! She's lost! Oh, oh, oh! They said
they saw her comin' up this way, this mornin'.
<i>Hev</i> you seen her, <i>hev</i> you?"</p>

<p>Earl and his father and mother were having
tea there in the handsome oak-panelled dining-room.
Mr. Munroe rose at once, and went forward,
Mrs. Munroe looked with a pale face
around her silver tea-urn, and Earl sat as if
frozen. He heard his father's soothing questions,
and the mother's answers. She had been
out at work all day; when she returned, Jenny
was gone. Some one had seen her going up the
road to the Munroes' that morning about ten
o'clock. That was her only clew.</p>

<p>Earl sat there, and saw his mother draw the
poor woman into the room and try to comfort
her; he heard, with a vague understanding, his
father order the horses to be harnessed immediately;
he watched him putting on his coat and
hat out in the hall.</p>

<p>When he heard the horses trot up the drive,
he sprang to his feet. When Mr. Munroe opened
the door, Earl, with his coat and cap on, was at
his heels.</p>

<p>"Why, you can't go, Earl!" said his father,
when he saw him. "Go back at once."</p>

<p>Earl was white and trembling. He half
sobbed: "Oh, father, I must go!" said he.</p>

<p>"Earl, be reasonable. You want to help, don't
you, and not hinder?" his mother called out of
the dining-room.</p>

<p>Earl caught hold of his father's coat. "Father&mdash;look
here&mdash;I&mdash;<i>I believe I know where she is</i>!"</p>

<p>Then his father faced sharply around, his
mother and Jenny's stood listening in bewilderment,
and Earl told his ridiculous, childish, and
cruel little story. "I&mdash;didn't dream&mdash;she'd
really be&mdash;such a little&mdash;goose as to&mdash;go," he
choked out; "but she must have, for"&mdash;with
brave candor&mdash;"I know she believed every word
I told her."</p>

<p>It seemed a fantastic theory, yet a likely one.
It would give method to the search, yet more
alarm to the searchers. The mountain was a
wide region in which to find one little child.</p>

<p>Jenny's mother screamed out, "Oh, if she's
lost on the mountain, they'll never find her!
They never will, they never will! Oh, Jenny,
Jenny, Jenny!"</p>

<p>Earl gave a despairing glance at her, and bolted
up-stairs to his own room. His mother called
pityingly after him; but he only sobbed back,
"Don't, mother&mdash;please!" and kept on.</p>

<p>The boy, lying face downward on his bed, crying
as if his heart would break, heard presently
the church-bell clang out fast and furious. Then
he heard loud voices down in the road, and the
flurry of sleigh-bells. His father had raised the
alarm, and the search was organized.</p>

<p>After a while Earl arose, and crept over to the
window. It looked towards the mountain, which
towered up, cold and white and relentless, like
one of the ice-hearted giants of the old Indian
tales. Earl shuddered as he looked at it. Presently
he crawled down-stairs and into the parlor.
In the bay-window stood, like a gay mockery,
the Christmas-tree. It was a quite small one
that year, only for the family&mdash;some expected
guests had failed to come&mdash;but it was well laden.
After tea the presents were to have been distributed.
There were some for his father and
mother, and some for the servants, but the bulk
of them were for Earl.</p>

<p>By-and-by his mother, who had heard him
come down-stairs, peeped into the room, and saw
him busily taking his presents from the tree.
Her heart sank with sad displeasure and amazement.
She would not have believed that her boy
could be so utterly selfish as to think of Christmas-presents
<i>then</i>.</p>

<p>But she said nothing. She stole away, and
returned to poor Mrs. Brown, whom she was keeping
with her; still she continued to think of it
all that long, terrible night, when they sat there
waiting, listening to the signal-horns over on the
mountain.</p>

<p>Morning came at last and Mr. Munroe with it.
No success so far. He drank some coffee and
was off again. That was quite early. An hour
or two later the breakfast-bell rang. Earl did
not respond to it, so his mother went to the foot
of the stairs and called him. There was a stern
ring in her soft voice. All the time she had in
mind his heartlessness and greediness over the
presents. When Earl did not answer she went
up-stairs, and found that he was not in his room.
Then she looked in the parlor, and stood staring
in bewilderment. Earl was not there, but neither
were the Christmas-tree and his presents&mdash;they
had vanished bodily!</p>

<p>Just at that moment Earl Munroe was hurrying
down the road, and he was dragging his big
sled, on which were loaded his Christmas-presents
and the Christmas-tree. The top of the tree
trailed in the snow, its branches spread over the
sled on either side, and rustled. It was a heavy
load, but Earl tugged manfully in an enthusiasm
of remorse and atonement&mdash;a fantastic, extravagant
atonement, planned by that same fertile
fancy which had invented that story for poor
little Jenny, but instigated by all the good, repentant
impulses in the boy's nature.</p>

<p>On every one of those neat parcels, above his
own name, was written in his big crooked, childish
hand, "Jenny Brown, from&mdash;" Earl Munroe
had not saved one Christmas-present for himself.</p>

<p>Pulling along, his eyes brilliant, his cheeks
glowing, he met Maud Barker. She was Judge
Barker's daughter, and the girl who had joined
him in advising Jenny to hunt on the mountain
for the Christmas-tree.</p>

<p>Maud stepped along, placing her trim little
feet with dainty precision; she wore some new
high-buttoned overshoes. She also carried a new
beaver muff, but in one hand only. The other
dangled mittenless at her side; it was pink with
cold, but on its third finger sparkled a new gold
ring with a blue stone in it.</p>

<p>"Oh, Earl!" she called out, "have they found
Jenny Brown? I was going up to your house
to&mdash;Why, Earl Munroe, what have you got
there?"</p>

<p>"I'm carrying up my Christmas-presents and the
tree up to Jenny's&mdash;so she'll find 'em when she
comes back," said the boy, flushing red. There
was a little defiant choke in his voice.</p>

<p>"Why, what for?"</p>

<p>"I rather think they belong to her more'n
they do to me, after what's happened."</p>

<p>"Does your mother know?"</p>

<p>"No; she wouldn't care. She'd think I was
only doing what I ought."</p>

<p>"All of 'em?" queried Maud, feebly.</p>

<p>"You don't s'pose I'd keep any back?"</p>

<p>Maud stood staring. It was beyond her little
philosophy.</p>

<p>Earl was passing on when a thought struck
him.</p>

<p>"Say, Maud," he cried, eagerly, "haven't you
something you can put in? Girls' things might
please her better, you know. Some of mine are&mdash;rather
queer, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"What have you got?" demanded Maud.</p>

<p>"Well, some of the things are well enough.
There's a lot of candy and oranges and figs and
books; there's one by Jules Verne I guess she'll
like; but there's a great big jack-knife, and&mdash;a
brown velvet bicycle suit?"</p>

<p>"Why, Earl Munroe! what could she do with
a bicycle suit?"</p>

<p>"I thought, maybe, she could rip the seams to
'em, an' sew 'em some way, an' get a basque cut,
or something. Don't you s'pose she could?"
Earl asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know; her mother could tell," said
Maud.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll hang it on, anyhow. Maud, haven't
you anything to give her?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't know."</p>

<p>Earl eyed her sharply. "Isn't that muff new?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And that ring?"</p>

<p>Maud nodded. "She'd be delighted with 'em.
Oh, Maud, put 'em in!"</p>

<p>Maud looked at him. Her pretty mouth quivered
a little; some tears twinkled in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't believe my mother would let me,"
faltered she. "You&mdash;come with me, and I'll ask
her."</p>

<p>"All right," said Earl, with a tug at his sled-rope.</p>

<p>He waited with his load in front of Maud's
house until she came forth radiant, lugging a big
basket. She had her last winter's red cashmere
dress, a hood, some mittens, cake and biscuit, and
nice slices of cold meat.</p>

<p>"Mother said these would be much more <i>suitable</i>
for her," said Maud, with a funny little imitation
of her mother's manner.</p>

<p>Over across the street another girl stood at
the gate, waiting for news.</p>

<p>"Have they found her?" she cried. "Where
are you going with all those things?"</p>

<p>Somehow, Earl's generous, romantic impulse
spread like an epidemic. This little girl soon
came flying out with her contribution; then there
were more&mdash;quite a little procession filed finally
down the road to Jenny Brown's house.</p>

<p>The terrible possibilities of the case never occurred
to them. The idea never entered their
heads that little, innocent, trustful Jenny might
never come home to see that Christmas-tree
which they set up in her poor home.</p>

<p>It was with no surprise whatever that they
saw, about noon, Mr. Munroe's sleigh, containing
Jenny and her mother and Mrs. Munroe, drive
up to the door.</p>

<p>Afterwards they heard how a wood-cutter had
found Jenny crying, over on the east side of the
mountain, at sunset, and had taken her home
with him. He lived five miles from the village,
and was an old man, not able to walk so far that
night to tell them of her safety. His wife had
been very good to the child. About eleven
o'clock some of the searchers had met the old
man plodding along the mountain-road with the
news.</p>

<p>They did not stop for this now. They shouted
to Jenny to "come in, quick!" They pulled her
with soft violence into the room where they had
been at work. Then the child stood with her
hands clasped, staring at the Christmas-tree. All
too far away had she been searching for it. The
Christmas-tree grew not on the wild mountainside,
in the lonely woods, but at home, close to
warm, loving hearts; and that was where she
found it.</p>

<h2><a name="WHERE_SARAH_JANES_DOLL_WENT" id="WHERE_SARAH_JANES_DOLL_WENT"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">WHERE SARAH JANE'S DOLL WENT</a></h2>


<p>In the first place, Sarah Jane had no right to
take the doll to school, but the temptation was
too much for her. The doll was new&mdash;it was,
in fact, only one day old&mdash;and such a doll! Rag,
of course&mdash;Sarah Jane had heard only vague rumors
of other kinds&mdash;but no more like the ordinary
rag doll than a fairy princess is like a dairy-maid.
The minute that Sarah Jane saw it she
knew at once that there never had been such a
doll. It was small&mdash;not more than seven or
eight inches tall&mdash;not by any means the usual
big, sprawling, moon-faced rag baby with its
arms standing out at right angles with its body.
It was tiny and genteel in figure, slim-waisted,
and straight-backed. It was made of, not common
cotton cloth, but linen&mdash;real glossy white
linen&mdash;which Sarah Jane's mother, and consequently
the doll's grandmother, had spun and
wove. Its face was colored after a fashion
which was real high art to Sarah Jane. The
little cheeks and mouth were sparingly flushed
with cranberry juice, and the eyes beamed blue
with indigo. The nose was delicately traced
with a quill dipped in its grandfather's ink-stand,
and though not quite as natural as the rest of
the features, showed fine effort. Its little wig
was made from the fine ravellings of Serena's
brown silk stockings.</p>

<p>Serena was Sarah Jane's married sister, who
lived in the next house across the broad green
yard, and she had made this wonderful doll.
She brought it over one evening just before
Sarah Jane went to bed. "There," said she, "if
you'll be a real good girl I'll give you this."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Sarah Jane, and she could say no
more.</p>

<p>Serena, who was only a girl herself, dandled
the doll impressively before her bewildered eyes.
It was dressed in a charming frock made from a
bit of Serena's best French calico. The frock
was of a pale lilac color with roses sprinkled
over it, and was cut with a low neck and short
puffed sleeves.</p>

<p>"Now, Sarah Jane," said Serena, admonishingly,
"there's one thing I want to tell you: you
mustn't carry this doll to school. If you do,
you'll lose it; and if you do, you won't get another
very soon. It was a good deal of work to
make it. Now you mind what I say."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Sarah Jane. It was not
her habit to say ma'am to her sister Serena, if
she was twelve years older than she; but she
did now, and reached out impatiently for the
doll.</p>

<p>"Well, you remember," said Serena. "If you
take it to school and lose it, it'll be the last doll
you'll get."</p>

<p>And Sarah Jane said, "Yes, ma'am," again.</p>

<p>She had to go to bed directly, but she took
the new doll with her; that was not forbidden,
much to her relief. And before she went to
sleep she had named her with a most flowery
name, nothing less than Lily Rosalie Violet May.
It took her a long time to decide upon it, but
she was finally quite satisfied, and went to sleep
hugging Lily Rosalie, and dreamed about her
next day's spelling lesson&mdash;that she failed and
went to the foot of the class.</p>

<p>It was singular, but for once a dream of Sarah
Jane's came true. She actually did miss in her
spelling lesson the next day; and although she
did not go quite to the foot of the class, she went
very near to it. But if Sarah Jane was not able
to spell <i>scissors</i> correctly, she could have spelled
with great success Lily Rosalie Violet May. All
the evening she had been printing it over and
over on a fly-leaf of her spelling-book. She
could feel no interest in scissors, which had no
connection, except a past one, with her beloved
new doll.</p>

<p>Poor Sarah Jane lived such a long way from
school that she had to carry her dinner with
her, so there was a whole day's separation, when
she had only possessed Lily Rosalie for a matter
of twelve hours. It was hard.</p>

<p>She told some of her particular cronies about
her, and described her charms with enthusiasm,
but it was not quite equal to displaying her in
person.</p>

<p>The little girls promised to come over and see
the new doll just as soon as their mothers would
let them, and one, Ruth Gurney, who was Sarah
Jane's especial friend, said she would go home
with her that very night&mdash;she didn't believe her
mother would care&mdash;but they were going to have
company at tea, and she was afraid if she were
late, and had to sit at the second table, that she
wouldn't get any currant tarts.</p>

<p>Sarah Jane did not urge her; she had a shy
little pride of her own; but she felt deeply hurt
that Ruth could prefer currant tarts to a sight
of Lily Rosalie.</p>

<p>She was rather apt to loiter on her way home.
There was much temptation to at this time of
the year, when the meadows on either side of
the road were so brimful of grass and flowers,
when the air was so sweet, and so many birds
were singing. There was a brook on the way,
and occasionally Sarah Jane used to stop and
have a little secret wade. It was one of those
pleasures which, although not actually prohibited,
was doubtful. Sarah Jane had at times got
the hem of her little blue calico gown draggled,
and met with a reprimand at home.</p>

<p>But to-night neither nodding way-side flowers
nor softly rippling brook had any attraction for
her. Straight home, her little starched white
sun-bonnet pointing ahead unswervingly, her
small pattering feet never turning aside from
the narrow beaten track between the way-side
grasses, she went to Lily Rosalie Violet May.</p>

<p>She found her just as beautiful as when she
left her. That long day of absence, filled in with
her extravagant childish fancy, had not caused
her charms to lessen in the least.</p>

<p>Sarah Jane ran straight to the linen chest, in
whose till she had hidden for safety the precious
doll, and there she lay, her indigo blue eyes staring
up, smiling at her with the sweet cranberry-colored
smile which Serena had fixed on her
face. Sarah Jane caught her up in rapture.</p>

<p>Her mother told Serena that night that she
didn't know when she'd seen the child so tickled
with anything as she was with that doll.</p>

<p>"She didn't carry it to the school, did she?"
said Serena.</p>

<p>"No. I guess she won't want to, as long as
you told her not to," replied her mother.</p>

<p>Sarah Jane had been always an obedient little
girl; but&mdash;she had never before had Lily Rosalie
Violet May. Her mother did not consider
that.</p>

<p>Sarah Jane did not have a pocket made in her
dress; it was not then the fashion. Instead, she
wore a very large-sized one, made of stout cotton,
tied around her waist by a string under her
dress skirt. The next day, when Sarah Jane
went to school, she carried in this pocket her
new doll. She was quite late this morning, so
there was no time to display it before school
commenced.</p>

<p>Once, when the high arithmetic class was out
on the floor, she pulled it slyly out of her pocket,
held it under her desk, and poked Ruth Gurney,
who sat in the next seat.</p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped Ruth, almost aloud. The doll
seemed to fascinate everybody. "Let me take
it," motioned Ruth; but Sarah Jane shook a
wise head, and slid Lily Rosalie back in her
pocket. She was not going to run the risk of
having her confiscated by the teacher. But
when recess came Sarah Jane was soon the
proud little centre of an admiring group.</p>

<p>"Sarah Jane's got the handsomest new doll,"
one whispered to another, and they all crowded
around. Even some of the "big girls" came,
and two or three of the big boys. Sarah Jane
was one of the smallest girls in school, and sat in
the very front seat. Now she felt like a big girl
herself. This wonderful doll raised her at once
to a position of importance. There she stood in
the corner by the window, and proudly held it.
She wore a blue cotton dress cut after the fashion
of Lily Rosalie's, with a low neck and short
sleeves, displaying her dimpled childish neck and
arms. Her round cheeks were flushed with a
softer pink than the doll's, and her honest brown
eyes were full of delight.</p>

<p>One and another of the girls begged for the
privilege of taking the doll a moment for a closer
scrutiny, and Sarah Jane would grant it, and
then watch them with thinly veiled anxiety.
Suppose their fingers shouldn't be quite clean,
and there should be a spot on Lily Rosalie's
beautiful white linen skin! One of the girls
rubbed her cheeks to see if the red would come
off, and Sarah Jane wriggled.</p>

<p>Joe West was one of the big boys who had
joined the group. Years after, he was Joseph
B. West, an eminent city lawyer. Years after
that, he was Judge West of the Superior Court.
Now he was simply Joe West, a tall, lanky boy
with a long rosy face and a high forehead. His
arms came too far through his jacket sleeves,
and showed his wrists, which looked unnaturally
knobby and bony. He went barefoot all summer
long, and was much given to chewing sassafras.</p>

<p>He offered a piece to Sarah Jane now, extracting
it with gravity from a mass of chalk, top
strings, buttons, nails, and other wealth with
which his pocket was filled.</p>

<p>Sarah Jane accepted it with a modest little
blush, and plumped it into her rosy mouth.</p>

<p>Then Joe West followed up his advantage.
"Say, Sarah Jane," said he, "lemme take her a
minute."</p>

<p>She eyed him doubtfully. Somehow she mistrusted
him. Joe West had rather the reputation
of being a wag and a sore tease.</p>

<p>"She's just the prettiest doll I ever saw," Joe
went on. "Lemme take her just a minute,
Sarah Jane; now do."</p>

<p>"He's just stuffing you, Sarah Jane; don't you
let him touch it," spoke out one of the big girls.</p>

<p>"Stuffing" was a very expressive word in the
language of the school. Sarah Jane shook her
head with a timid little smile, and hugged Lily
Rosalie tighter.</p>

<p>"Now do, Sarah Jane. I wouldn't be stingy.
Haven't I just given you some sassafras?"</p>

<p>That softened her a little. The spicy twang
of the sassafras was yet on her tongue. "I'm
afraid you won't give her back to me," murmured
she.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will, honest. Now do, Sarah Jane."</p>

<p>It was against her better judgment; the big
girl again raised her warning voice; but Joe
West adroitly administered a little more flattery,
and followed it up with entreaty, and Sarah
Jane, yielding, finally put her precious little white
linen baby into his big grimy, out-reaching hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, the pretty little sing!" said Joe West
then, in an absurdly soft voice, and dandled it up
and down. "What's its name, Sarah Jane?"</p>

<p>And Sarah Jane in her honesty and simplicity
repeated that flowery name.</p>

<p>"Lily Rosalie Violet May," said Joe, after her,
softly. And everybody giggled.</p>

<p>A pink color spread all over Sarah Jane's face
and dimpled neck; tears sprang to her eyes. She
felt as if they were poking fun at something sacred;
her honest childish confidence was betrayed.
"Give her back to me, Joe West!" she
cried.</p>

<p>But Joe only dandled it out of her reach, and
then the bell rang. The children trooped back
into the school-room, and Joe quietly slipped the
doll into his pocket and marched gravely to his
seat.</p>

<p>Every time when Sarah Jane gazed around at
him he was studying his geography with the
most tireless industry. She could hardly wait
for school to be done; when it was, she tried to
get to Joe, but he was too quick for her. He had
started with his long stride down the road before
she could get to the door. She called after him,
but he appeared to have suddenly grown deaf.
The other girls condoled with her, all but the
big girl who had given the warning. "You'd
ought to have listened to me," said she, severely,
as she tied on her sun-bonnet in the entry. "I
told you how it would be, letting a boy have
hold of it."</p>

<p>Sarah Jane was not much comforted. She
crept forlornly along towards home. Joe West's
house was on the way. There was a field south
of it. As she came to this field she saw Joe out
there with the bossy. This bossy, which was
tethered to an old apple-tree, was cream-colored,
with a white star on her forehead and a neck
and head like a deer. She stood knee-deep in
the daisies and clover, and looked like a regular
picture-calf. If Sarah Jane had not been so
much occupied with her own troubles, she would
have stopped to gaze with pleasure at the pretty
creature.</p>

<p>Joe stood at her head and appeared to be teasing
her. She twitched away from him, and
lunged at him playfully with her budding horns.</p>

<p>"Joe! Joe!" called quaking little Sarah Jane.</p>

<p>Joe West gave one glance at her; his face
flushed a burning red; then he left the bossy
and went with long strides across the fields towards
his home. The poor girl followed him.</p>

<p>"Joe! Joe!" called the little despairing voice,
but he never turned his head.</p>

<p>Sarah Jane got past his house; then she sat
down beside the road and wept. She did not
know how Joe West, remorseful and penitent,
was peeping at her from his window. She did
not know of the tragedy which had just been
enacted over there in the clover-field. The
bossy calf, who was hungry for all strange articles
of food, had poked her inquiring nose into
Joe West's jacket pocket, whence a bit of French
calico emerged, had caught hold of it, and, in
short, had then and there eaten up Lily Rosalie
Violet May. Joe had made an attempt to pull
her by her silken wig out of that greedy mouth,
but the bossy calmly chewed on.</p>

<p>It was just as well that Sarah Jane did not
know it at the time. She had enough to bear&mdash;her
own distress over the loss of the doll, and the
reproaches of Serena and her mother. They
agreed that the loss of the doll served her right
for her disobedience, and that nothing should be
said to Joe West. They also thought the affair
too trivial to fuss over. Lily Rosalie even in her
designer's eyes was not what she was to Sarah
Jane.</p>

<p>"If you'd minded me you wouldn't have lost
it," said Serena. "I am not going to make you
another."</p>

<p>Sarah Jane hung her head meekly. But in
the course of three months she had another doll
in a very unexpected and curious way.</p>

<p>One evening there was a knock on the side
door, and when it was opened there was no one
there, but on the step lay a big package directed
to Sarah Jane. It contained a real bought doll,
with a china head and a cloth body, who was
gorgeously and airily attired in pink tarlatan
with silver spangles. The memory of Lily Rosalie
paled.</p>

<p>There was great wonder and speculation. Nobody
dreamed how poor Joe West had driven
cows from pasture, and milked, and chopped
wood, out of school-hours, and taken every cent
he had earned and bought this doll to atone for
the theft of Lily Rosalie Violet May.</p>

<p>Sarah Jane's mother declared that she should
not carry this doll, no matter whence it came, to
school, and she never did but once&mdash;that was on
her birthday, and she teased so hard, and promised
not to let any one take her, that her mother
consented.</p>

<p>At recess Sarah Jane was again the centre of
attraction. She turned that wonderful pink tarlatan
lady round and round before the admiring
eyes; but when Joe West, meek and mildly conciliatory,
approached the circle, she clutched her
tightly and turned her back on him.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to have Joe West steal another
doll," said she. And Joe colored and retreated.</p>

<p>Years afterwards, when Joe was practising law
in the city, and came home for a visit, and Sarah
Jane was so grown-up that she wore a white
muslin hat with rosebuds, and a black silk mantilla,
to church, she knew the whole story, and
they had a laugh over it.</p>

<p>"You needn't waste any more time talkin'
about it, Benjamin; you can jest take that
puppy-dog and carry him off. I don't care
what you do with him; you can carry him back
where you got him, or give him away, or swap
him off; but jest as sure as you leave him here
half an hour longer, I'll call Jimmy up from the
hay-field and have him shoot him. I won't have
a dog round the place, nohow. Couldn't keep
Seventoes a minute; he's dreadful scart of dogs."</p>

<p>"Grandsir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take that puppy-dog and go along, I tell
ye. I won't have any more talk about it."</p>

<p>Benjamin Wellman, small and slight, sandy-haired
and blue-eyed, stood before his grandfather,
who sat in his big arm-chair in the east
door. Benjamin held in his right hand an old
rope, which was attached to a leather strap
around a puppy's neck. The puppy pulled at
the rope, keeping it taut all the time. He also
yelped shrilly. He did not like to be tied. The
puppy was not a pretty one, being yellow and very
clumsy; but Benjamin thought him a beauty.
He had urged to his grandfather that there
would not be a dog to equal him in the neighborhood
when he was grown up, but the old man
had not been moved.</p>

<p>There were tears in Benjamin's pretty blue
eyes, but his square chin looked squarer. He
tried to speak again. "Grandsir&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Not another word," said his grandfather.</p>

<p>Benjamin looked past his grandfather into the
kitchen. His mother sat in there stemming currants.
He went around to the other door and
entered, dragging the puppy after him.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said, in a low voice, "can't I
keep him?"</p>

<p>His grandfather in the east door looked around
suspiciously, but he could hear nothing; he was
somewhat deaf.</p>

<p>"No; not if your grandfather don't want you
to," said his mother; "you know I can't let you,
Benjamin."</p>

<p>The puppy was whining piteously, and Benjamin
seemed to echo it when he spoke. "I
don't see why he don't want me to. It ain't as
if C&aelig;sar was a common puppy. You ask him,
mother."</p>

<p>"No," returned his mother; "it won't do any
good. You know how much he thinks of Seventoes,
and the dog might kill him when he was
grown."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't care if he did," muttered Benjamin;
"nothing but a cross old stealing cat;
don't begin to be worth what this puppy is."</p>

<p>"Now, Benjamin, you mustn't talk any more
about it," said his mother, severely. "Grandsir
does too much for you and me for you to make
any fuss about a thing like this. Take that
puppy and run right along with it, as he tells
you to."</p>

<p>Grandsir's suspicions suddenly took shape
then. "Benjamin, you run right along," he
called out; "don't stand there teasing your
mother about it."</p>

<p>So Benjamin gathered the puppy up into his
arms with a jerk&mdash;it was impossible to lead him
any distance&mdash;and plunged out of the house.
He gave two or three little choking sobs as he
hurried along. It was a hot day, and he was
tired and disappointed and discouraged. He
had walked three miles over to the village and
back to get that puppy, and now he had to walk
a mile more to give it away. He had no doubt
whatever as to the disposal of it; he knew Sammy
Tucker would give it a hearty welcome, for
there was an understanding to that effect. Benjamin
had been a little doubtful as to the reception
the puppy might have from his grandfather;
but when Mr. Dyer, who kept the
village grocery store, had offered it to him three
weeks before, he had not had the courage to refuse.
Sammy Tucker, too, had been in the store,
buying three bars of soap for his mother, and he
had looked on admiringly and enviously. When
Benjamin had mentioned hesitatingly his doubts
about his grandfather, Sammy had pricked up
his ears.</p>

<p>"Say, Ben, you give him to me if your grandfather
won't let you keep him," he had whispered,
with a nudge. "Father said I might have
a dog soon as there was a good chance, and Mr.
Dyer won't want it back. He's giv away all
but this, and he wants to get rid of 'em. They're
common kind of dogs, anyhow. I heard him
say so."</p>

<p>Benjamin had looked at him stiffly. "Oh, I
guess grandsir'll let me keep this puppy, he's such
a smart one," he had answered, with dignity.</p>

<p>"Well, you ask him, and if he won't, I'll take
him," said Sammy.</p>

<p>But Benjamin had not asked his grandfather.
He had not had courage to run the risk. He
had waited the three weeks which the store-keeper
had said must elapse before the little dog
could leave its mother, and then had gone over
to the village and brought it home, without a
word to any one, trusting to the puppy's own
attractions to plead for it. It had seemed to
Benjamin that nobody could resist that puppy.
But Grandfather Wellman had all his life preferred
cats to dogs, and now he was childishly
fond of Seventoes. Benjamin's mother often
said that she didn't know what grandsir would
do if anything happened to Seventoes.</p>

<p>Benjamin, going out of the yard with the
puppy under his arm, could see Seventoes sitting
on the shed roof. That and the ledge of the old
well behind the barn were his favorite perches.
Grandfather Wellman thought he chose them
because he was so afraid of dogs. Benjamin
looked at him, and wished C&aelig;sar was big
enough to shake him. He had named the puppy
C&aelig;sar on his way home from the village.
There was a great mastiff over there by the
same name. Benjamin had always admired this
big C&aelig;sar, and now thought he would name his
dog after him. It was the same principle reduced
on which Benjamin himself had been
named after Benjamin Franklin.</p>

<p>Benjamin trudged down the road, kicking up
the dust with his toes. That was something he
had been told not to do, so now in this state of
mind he liked to do it. The sun beat down
fiercely upon his small red cropped head in the
burned straw-hat, and his slender shoulders in
the calico blouse. The puppy was large and fat
for his age, and made his arms ache. The stone-walls
on both sides of the road were hidden with
wild-rose and meadowsweet bushes; the fields
were dotted with hay-makers; now and then a
loaded hay-cart loomed up in the road. Many
boys no older than Benjamin had to work hard
in the hay-fields, but Grandfather Wellman was
too careful of him; he would not let him work
much in vacation; he had never been considered
very strong. But Benjamin did not think of
that. One grievance will outweigh a hundred
benefits. He hugged the struggling puppy tight
in his arms and trudged on painfully, brooding
over his wrongs.</p>

<p>He muttered to himself as he went, "Wanted
a dog ever since I was born. All the other boys
have got 'em. 'Ain't never had nothing but an
old cat. Sha'n't never have a chance to get such
a dog as this again. Wish something would
happen to that old cat; shouldn't care a mite."
He stubbed more fiercely into the dust, and it
flew higher; a squirrel ran across the road, and
he looked at it with an indifferent scowl.</p>

<p>When he reached Sammy Tucker's house he
saw Sammy out in the great north yard raking
hay with his father. Sammy looked up and
saw Benjamin coming.</p>

<p>"Holloa!" he sang out, eagerly. Then he
dropped his rake and raced into the road. His
black eyes winked fast with excitement. "Say,
won't he let you keep him, Ben?" he cried.</p>

<p>"No; he won't let me keep nothing."</p>

<p>"Going to let me have him, then?"</p>

<p>"S'pose so."</p>

<p>Sammy reached forth his eager hands, and
took the kicking puppy from Benjamin's reluctant
arms. "Nice fellar&mdash;nice little fellar," said
he, tenderly.</p>

<p>"I've named him C&aelig;sar," said Benjamin.</p>

<p>"That's a good name," assented Sammy. "Hi,
C&aelig;sar! Hi, sir!"</p>

<p>Sammy's father came smilingly forward to the
fence; he was fond of dogs. He also took the
puppy, and talked to it. Benjamin thought to
himself that he wished his grandfather was more
like Sammy's father. He looked on gloomily.</p>

<p>"Hate to give it up, don't you, Ben?" said
Mr. Tucker, kindly.</p>

<p>"Sha'n't never have such a chance again."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you will; your grandfather'll let
you have a dog some time."</p>

<p>"No; he won't never let me have nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you give up yet, Ben."</p>

<p>Benjamin shook his head like a discouraged
old man, and turned to go home.</p>

<p>"Sammy'll feed him, and take real good care
of him, and you can come over here and see
him," Mr. Tucker called after him, as he went
down the road.</p>

<p>Benjamin thought to himself that he should
not want to, as he marched wearily homeward.
His arms were lightened of the puppy, but his
heart seemed heavy within him. Two boys
whom he knew sang out to him from a load of
hay, but he gave only a grim nod in response.
"<i>They've</i> got a dog," he muttered; and indeed
the pretty shepherd dog was following after the
load.</p>

<p>Benjamin, when he came in sight of home,
thought he would take a short-cut through the
orchard. He meditated stealing up the back
stairs to his chamber, staying up there, and saying
that he did not want any supper; he was
not hungry. They had not cut the grass in the
orchard, and he plunged through clover, feathery
grass, and daisies to his waist. He felt
pleased to think how he was making a furrow
through his grandfather's hay. He emerged
from the orchard, and went on towards the
barn; directly back of it was the old well.
When he reached that he stopped short. There
was Seventoes&mdash;beautiful great yellow cat&mdash;stretched
in the sun, all his wonderful seven-toed
paws spread out. The ledge of the old
well was a strange place for a cat, but Seventoes
was fond of it, and stayed there much of the time
when he was not on the shed roof.</p>

<p>Benjamin walked close to the well and looked
at Seventoes. His small face was burning red
with the heat; his blue eyes gleamed angrily.
"You lazy old cat," said he. He stood a second
longer; then he thrust out his right hand and
gave Seventoes a push. There was a piteous
yawl and a great clawing, and Seventoes was
out of sight. Benjamin ran. He gasped; a
white streak was settling around his mouth.
He was well versed in Bible stories, and he
thought of Cain. What had he done? What
would happen to him? Could he ever get away
from his guilt, run fast as he would? Benjamin
ran as he had never run before, his heart pounding,
although he did not know clearly what he
was running for. He tore around the barn,
through the pasture bars, towards the house.
When he came in sight of the shed a great
qualm of guilt and remorse forced him to glance
up at the place where poor Seventoes had so
loved to sit, and where he would sit no more.
Benjamin glanced, then he stood stock-still, fairly
aghast with awe and terror&mdash;<i>there sat Seventoes</i>!</p>

<p>All the red faded out of Benjamin's cheeks.
He had never been encouraged in superstitious
beliefs, but he was an imaginative child, and just
now bewildered and unstrung. He stared at the
shed roof. Yes! he saw Seventoes there, and
Seventoes was at the bottom of the old well.
Had he not seen him fall, clawing, down?</p>

<p>Benjamin rushed staggering into the kitchen.
"Oh, grandsir! oh, mother!" he wailed&mdash;"oh,
I've pushed Seventoes into the old well and
drowned him, and his ghost's sitting on the shed
roof! Oh, mother!"</p>

<p>Grandfather Wellman was confined to his
chair with rheumatism, but he arose. "Pushed
Seventoes into the well," he repeated, while Benjamin's
mother turned as pale as her son.</p>

<p>"I have&mdash;I have," sobbed Benjamin. "I
didn't know I was going to, but I have. And
he's in the well, and he's sitting on the shed roof
too. Oh!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" his mother gasped.
"Stop acting so, and tell me what you've done."</p>

<p>"I pushed Seventoes into the old well. I
didn't know I was going to, but I did; and he's
dead in there, and he's on the shed roof. Oh,
mother!"</p>

<p>"You 'ain't pushed that cat into the well?"
groaned Grandfather Wellman. "If you have&mdash;"
He was trying to limp across the kitchen with
his cane. He, too, was pale, and trembling from
head to foot. "Hannah," he said to Benjamin's
mother, "you come right along quick, and see if
we can't get him out. I wouldn't take a hundred
dollars for that cat."</p>

<p>Benjamin's mother started. Benjamin, sobbing
and trembling, was clinging to her. Just
then <i>Seventoes walked in through the east door</i>,
his splendid ringed tail waving a little uneasily,
but not a hair of him was hurt. A frightened
cat can run faster than a guilty little boy, and
Seventoes had found his unusual number of
claws of good service in climbing a well and retarding
his progress towards the bottom.</p>

<p>They all looked.</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;Seventoes?" gasped Benjamin, with
wild eyes.</p>

<p>"Of course it's Seventoes," growled his grandfather.
"I'd like to know what you've been
cutting up so for. Pussy, pussy, pussy."</p>

<p>Benjamin's mother took him over to the sink,
and put some water on his head, and made him
drink some. "There's no such thing as a ghost,
and you're acting very silly," said she; "but I
don't wonder you are scared, when you've done
such a dreadful thing. It scares me to think of
it. It was 'most as bad as killing somebody. I
never thought a boy of mine would do such a
thing. Grandsir good as he is to you, too."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;won't ever do so&mdash;again," sobbed Benjamin,
all trembling. "I'm sorry; I <i>am</i> sorry."</p>

<p>Benjamin was not whipped, the scourging of
his own conscience had been severe enough, but
he sat pale and sober in the kitchen, while grandsir,
with Seventoes on his knees, and his mother
talked to him.</p>

<p>"If you ever do anything like this again, Benjamin,"
said his grandfather, "I shall be ha'sh
with you, ha'sher than I've ever been, and you
must remember it."</p>

<p>"I guess he must," said his mother. "It was
a dreadful wicked thing, and he should be punished
now if I didn't think he'd suffered enough
from his own guilty conscience for this time, and
would never as long as he lived do such a terrible
thing again."</p>

<p>"I won't&mdash;I&mdash;won't!" choked Benjamin.</p>

<p>At supper-time, when the new milk was
brought in from the barn, Benjamin filled a saucer
with it and carried it to the door for Seventoes.
He filled it so full that he spilled it all the
way over the clean kitchen floor, but his mother
said nothing. Seventoes lapped his milk happily;
Benjamin, with his little contrite, tear-stained
face, stood watching him, and grandsir
sat in his arm-chair. Over in the fields the hay-makers
were pitching the last loads into the
carts; the east sky was red with the reflected
color of the west. Everything was sweet and
cool and peaceful, and the sun was not going
down on Benjamin's childish wrath. His grandfather
put out his hand and patted his little red
cropped head, "You're always going to be a
good boy after this, ain't you, sonny?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Benjamin, and he got down

<p>By the 1st of June Mrs. Thayer had the sun-bonnets
done. There were four of them, for the
four youngest girls&mdash;Eliza, Mary Ann, Harriet,
and Mirandy. She had five daughters besides
these, but two were married and gone away from
home, and the other three were old enough to
make their own sun-bonnets.</p>

<p>There were four Thayer boys; one of them
came next to Mirandy, the youngest girl, the
others ranked upward in age from Harriet, who
was eleven, to Sarah Jane, who was sixteen.
There were thirteen sons and daughters in all
in Josiah Thayer's family, and eleven were at
home. It was hard work to get enough from
the stony New England farm to feed them; and
let Mrs. Thayer card and spin and dye and
weave as she would, the clothing often ran
short. And so it happened that little Mirandy
Thayer, aged six, had no shoes to her feet.</p>

<p>One Sunday in June she cried because she had
to go to meeting barefooted.</p>

<p>"Ain't you ashamed of yourself, a great big
girl like you, crying?" said her mother, sternly.
"You go right over there, and sit down on the
settle till father gets hitched up, and Daniel, you
go and sit down 'side of her, and teach her the
first question in the catechism. She'd ought to
find out there's something else to be thought
about on the Sabbath day besides shoes."</p>

<p>So Mirandy, sniffing between the solemn
words, repeated them after Daniel, who was
twelve years old, and knew his catechism quite
thoroughly. And when the great farm wagon,
with the team of oxen, stood before the door,
she climbed in with the rest without a murmur.</p>

<p>But sitting in the meeting-house through the
two hours' discourse, she drew up her little bare
feet under her blue petticoat, and going down
the aisle afterwards, she crouched, making it
sweep the floor, until her mother dragged her
up forcibly by one arm.</p>

<p>"Ain't you ashamed of yourself?" she whispered.
"A great big girl like you!"</p>

<p>Mirandy was in reality very small for her age,
and everybody called her "little;" but she got
very few privileges on account of her youth and
littleness. In those days, and especially in a
family like Josiah Thayer's, where there were so
many children that each had to scratch for itself
at an early age or go without, six years was considered
comparatively mature, and the child who
had lived that long was not exempt from many
duties.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Thayer did not think herself in the
least severe when she said to Mirandy after
meeting: "If you want some shoes so bad, you'll
have to work an' earn 'em."</p>

<p>Mirandy looked up inquiringly at her mother.</p>

<p>"You can pick berries an' sell 'em," replied
her mother. "You're plenty big enough to."</p>

<p>Mirandy said nothing, and soon her mother set
her to rocking Jonathan in his red wooden cradle;
but as she sat, with her small bare foot on
the rocker, ambition expanded wider and wider
in her childish soul, and she resolved that she
would earn some shoes.</p>

<p>The berries were not ripe before the middle
of July. She had some five weeks to wait before
she could fairly begin work. But not a day
passed that she did not visit the pastures to see
if the berries were ripe. She brought home so
many partially ripe ones for samples that her
brothers and sisters remonstrated. They, too,
were vitally interested in the berry crop in behalf
of shoes and many other things. "She
won't leave any berries on the bushes to get ripe
if she picks so many green ones," they complained,
and her mother issued a stern decree
that Mirandy should not go to the berry pasture
until the berries were fairly ripe.</p>

<p>But at last, one hot morning in July, the squad
of berry-pickers started. There were four Thayer
girls and two Thayer boys, besides Jonathan, the
baby, whom Eliza dragged in his little wooden
wagon.</p>

<p>"If you go berrying this mornin', you've got
to take Jonathan with you," Mrs. Thayer had
said. "Dorcas is weaving, an' Lyddy an' I have
got to dye. You'll have to take him out in the
pasture with you, an' tend him."</p>

<p>The berry pasture whither they were bound
was about a half-mile from home. The two boys
scurried on ahead, the four yellow sun-bonnets
marched bravely on, and Jonathan's wagon rattled
behind.</p>

<p>"The berries are real thick," said Harriet;
"but they say the bushes are loaded with 'em
over in Cap'n Moseby's lot, an' they're as big as
walnuts."</p>

<p>"He can't use quarter of 'em himself," returned
Mary Ann. "I call it real stingy not to
let folks go in there pickin'!" She nodded her
sun-bonnet indignantly.</p>

<p>When they reached the berry pasture, they
fell to work eagerly. Jonathan's wagon was
drawn up on one side, under the shade of a pine-tree,
and Mirandy was bidden to have an eye to
him. Nobody had much faith in the seriousness
of Mirandy's picking, and they thought that she
might as well tend Jonathan and leave them free.</p>

<p>But Mirandy stationed herself at a bush near
Jonathan, and began with a will. They all had
birch baskets fastened at their waists to pick
into, and they had brought buckets to fill. Mirandy
had hers as well as the rest.</p>

<p>The yellow sun-bonnets and the palm-leaf hats
waved about among the bushes, and the berries
fell fast into the birch-bark baskets. Mirandy
stayed close to Jonathan, as she had been bidden,
and she struggled bravely with her berry bush,
but it was too tall for her; the bushes in this pasture
were very tall. Mirandy tugged the branches
down, and panted for breath. She was eager to
fill her basket as soon as anybody. She heard
Harriet and Mary Ann talking near her, although
she could not see them.</p>

<p>"Cap'n Moseby's pasture is right over there.
You get over the stone-wall, and go across one
field, and you come to it," remarked Harriet.</p>

<p>"I s'pose the berries are as thick as spatters,"
said Mary Ann, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Dan'l says the bushes are dragging down
with 'em."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mary Ann, "nobody would dare
to go there, for he keeps that great black dog,
and I've heard he watches with a gun."</p>

<p>"So've I. No; I shouldn't dare to go. I
s'pose it would be stealing, anyway."</p>

<p>"I don't s'pose 'twould," rejoined Harriet,
hotly. "I guess if anything is free, berry pastures
are. Who planted berry bushes, I'd like to
know?"</p>

<p>"I s'pose the Lord did," said Mary Ann.
"Mebbe it ain't stealin', but anyhow I shouldn't
dare to go there."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't," agreed Harriet; "an' I know
Dan'l and Abijah wouldn't."</p>

<p>Mirandy listened; she thought both Harriet
and Mary Ann very wise. She trusted to their
conclusion that it would not be stealing to pick
Cap'n Moseby's berries, but she privately thought
she would "dare to."</p>

<p>Mirandy did not know what fear was; dogs
did not alarm her in the least; and as for Cap'n
Moseby and his gun, she knew he would not
shoot her; once he had given her some peppermints.</p>

<p>She pulled her bush down painfully, and
thought the berries were not very large, and
how fast those in Cap'n Moseby's pasture would
fill up. Harriet's and Mary Ann's voices grew
fainter. Mirandy let the bush fly back, and
pushed softly through a tangle of blackberry
vines to the stone-wall; a narrow stretch of
rocky land lay between it and the other which
bounded Cap'n Moseby's land. Mirandy stood
on tiptoe, and peered over; then she looked at
Jonathan asleep in his little wagon, his yellow
lashes on his pink cheeks, his fat fists doubled up.</p>

<p>Mirandy was loyal, although she was so young,
and she had been bidden not to leave Jonathan.
She looked at him, then at the stone-wall; it
was manifestly impossible for her to lift him
over that. She took hold of the little wagon,
and pushed it carefully along. She remembered
that she had seen some bars a little farther back.</p>

<p>When she reached the bars, she shook Jonathan
until he woke up. He stared at her in a
surprised way, but never cried; he was a good
baby.</p>

<p>"Put your arms round sister's neck," ordered
Mirandy; and Jonathan obeyed.</p>

<p>Mirandy tugged him out of his little wagon,
and they both rolled over under a berry bush.
Still Jonathan did not cry. He only gurgled a
little, by way of laugh. He thought Mirandy
was playing with him.</p>

<p>The bars were close together, and Mirandy
could not stir one. Jonathan gurgled again
when his sister rolled him, like a ball, under the
lowest bar, and then rolled under herself. But
it was harder for her to tug Jonathan across to
the other bars which guarded Cap'n Moseby's
berry pasture; he could only toddle feebly when
led by a strong hand. It was quite a puzzle for
six-year-old Mirandy, but she got him across and
under the other bars; then she set him down in
a sweet-fern thicket, and bade him keep still;
and he fell asleep again.</p>

<p>Mirandy picked until she had filled her bucket
and rounded it up. Her heart beat faster and
faster; her face was flushed and eager; she
looked a year older than when she started that
morning. She had seen no great black dog, and
Cap'n Moseby, with his gun, had not appeared.
In the distance she could see the hipped roof
and squat chimney of the Moseby house; but
nobody molested her.</p>

<p>When her bucket was full, she tugged Jonathan
across the field again. This time he rebelled;
a blackberry vine had scratched his little
legs, and his peace was too rudely disturbed.
Mirandy tugged him into his little wagon, and
he lay there kicking and screaming. She flew
back across the field for her bucket of berries.
She had been forced to leave it while she brought
Jonathan over, and the bucket was gone. She
had set it close to the bars, and there could be
no mistake about it.</p>

<p>Mirandy went back across the field; Jonathan
wailed louder than ever. Her four sisters were
gathered about his little wagon, and Daniel and
Abijah were coming through the bushes. Then
they all turned on her.</p>

<p>"Now, Mirandy Thayer, I'd like to know this
minute where you've been?" demanded Eliza.</p>

<p>Mirandy jerked her head backward.</p>

<p>"You 'ain't been over in Cap'n Moseby's
pasture?"</p>

<p>Mirandy nodded.</p>

<p>"She's been over in Cap'n Moseby's pasture,"
announced Eliza to the others.</p>

<p>They all stared at Mirandy, and paid no heed
to Jonathan's wails.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mirandy flung her little blue apron
over her face and began to weep.</p>

<p>"Did you get scared?" asked Harriet.</p>

<p>"Did the dog chase you?" asked Mary Ann,
very excitedly.</p>

<p>Mirandy shook her head, and sobbed harder.</p>

<p>"Did you see Cap'n Moseby with his gun?"
asked Daniel.</p>

<p>Mirandy shook her head.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be such a baby for nothing, then,"
said Daniel.</p>

<p>"I've lost my bucket!" sobbed Mirandy.</p>

<p>"Lost your bucket!" repeated Eliza. She was
the oldest sister there.</p>

<p>Mirandy nodded.</p>

<p>"You're a wicked girl!" Eliza said, severely.
"I don't know what mother'll say. Here's
Jonathan all scratched up, too. Did you take
him over there?"</p>

<p>"Yes," sobbed Mirandy.</p>

<p>"You're a dreadful wicked girl! Didn't you
know 'twas stealing?"</p>

<p>"Harriet said&mdash;it wasn't," returned Mirandy,
in feeble defence.</p>

<p>"It was. I shouldn't think you'd said such a
thing, Harriet."</p>

<p>"Of course it's stealing," said Daniel, soberly.</p>

<p>"Here you've been stealing," scolded Eliza;
"and your bucket's gone, and Jonathan is all
scratched up with blackberry vines. I don't
know what mother'll say."</p>

<p>She took Jonathan out of his wagon and
hushed him, and then they had a consultation
as to what was best to be done. Mirandy
related, with tearful breaks, the story of her
well-filled bucket and its mysterious disappearance.</p>

<p>"Of course Cap'n Moseby was watching out
there with his gun and took it," said Daniel.</p>

<p>It was finally agreed that they would all go
in a body to Cap'n Moseby's, and try to recover
Mirandy's bucket, that she might not have to
face her mother without it. When they reached
the Moseby house the doors were closed and the
windows looked blank. They knocked as loudly
as they dared, and there was not a sound in response.
They looked at one another.</p>

<p>"S'pose he ain't at home?" whispered Harriet.</p>

<p>"Dan'l, you pound on the door again," said
Eliza.</p>

<p>And Daniel pounded. Abijah pounded, too,
and Eliza herself rattled away on one panel, with
her freckled face screwed up, but nobody came.</p>

<p>"If he's there, he won't come to the door,"
said Daniel.</p>

<p>Suddenly the silence within the house was
broken. Then came a volley of quick barks,
and the children all fell back in a panic, and
scurried into the road.</p>

<p>"He's in there," said Daniel; "an' he's been
keeping the dog still, but he can't any longer."</p>

<p>"Just hear him!" whispered Harriet, with a
shudder.</p>

<p>The dog was not only barking and growling,
but leaping at the door.</p>

<p class="center">"THE VISIT TO CAP'N MOSEBY'S"</p>

<p>Mary Ann began to cry. "I'm going home,"
she sobbed. "S'pose that door should break;"
and she started down the road.</p>

<p>Eliza grasped the handle of Jonathan's wagon.
"I guess we might just as well go," she said.
"I don't b'lieve he'll come to the door if we
stand there a week. I don't know what mother'll
say when she finds that good bucket's gone.
I guess Mirandy'll catch it. An' when she finds
out she's been stealing, too, I don't know what
she will say."</p>

<p>The sorry procession started. Jonathan's wagon
creaked; but Mirandy stood still, with a stubborn
pout on her mouth, and her brows contracted
over her blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Come along, Mirandy," called Eliza, with a
foreboding voice.</p>

<p>But Mirandy stood still.</p>

<p>"Why don't you come?" Harriet said.</p>

<p>"I ain't coming," said Mirandy.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I ain't coming till I get my bucket."</p>

<p>Then the whole procession stopped, and reasoned
and argued, but Mirandy was unmoved.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do? You can't get
in," said Eliza.</p>

<p>"I'm going to sit on the door-step till Cap'n
Moseby comes out," answered Mirandy.</p>

<p>"You'll sit there all day, likely's not," said
Eliza. "What do you s'pose mother'll say?
I'm a-going to tell her."</p>

<p>"She'll send me right back again if I don't
stay," said Mirandy.</p>

<p>And there was some show of reason in what
she said. It was indeed quite probable that
Mrs. Josiah Thayer would send Mirandy straight
back again to confess her sins and get the bucket.</p>

<p>"I don't know but mother would send her
back," said Eliza; and Daniel nodded in assent.</p>

<p>"I'll stay with you," said Mary Ann, although
she was still trembling with fear of the dog.</p>

<p>"Don't want anybody to stay," protested Mirandy.</p>

<p>Finally she sat on Cap'n Moseby's door-step,
and watched them all straggle out of sight. The
creak of Jonathan's wagon grew fainter and
fainter, until she could hear it no longer. The
dog was quiet now. Mirandy sat up straight in
front of the panelled door.</p>

<p>She waited and waited; the time went on,
and it was high noon. She heard a dinner-horn
in the distance. She wondered vaguely if Cap'n
Moseby didn't have any dinner because he lived
alone. She began to feel hungry herself. There
was not a sound in the house. She wanted to
cry, but she would not. She sat perfectly still.
Once in a while she said over to herself the
questions she had learned from the catechism,
and she reflected much upon the two boys in the
<i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>. She had eaten a few of
the Cap'n's berries as she filled her bucket, and
she wondered that they did not make her ill, as
the fruit did the boys.</p>

<p>Nobody passed the house, the insects rasped
in her ears, she thought her forlorn childish
thoughts, and it was an hour after noon. She
did not see a curtain trimmed with white balls
in a window overhead pulled cautiously to one
side, and a grizzled head thrust out; but this
happened several times.</p>

<p>About two o'clock there was a sudden puff of
cool wind on her back; she glanced around,
trembling, and there stood Cap'n Moseby in the
open door, with his great black dog at his heels.
His old face was the color of tanned leather, and
full of severe furrows; his shaggy brows frowned
over sharp black eyes. He leaned upon a stout
oak staff, for he had been lamed by a British
musket-ball.</p>

<p>"Who's this?" he asked, in a grim voice.</p>

<p>Mirandy arose and stood about, and courtesied.
She could not find her tongue yet.</p>

<p>"Hey?" said Cap'n Moseby.</p>

<p>"Mirandy Thayer," she answered then, in a
shaking voice that had yet a touch of defiance
in it.</p>

<p>"Mirandy Thayer, hey? Well, what do you
want here, Mirandy Thayer?"</p>

<p>Mirandy dropped another courtesy. "My
bucket."</p>

<p>"Your bucket! What have I got to do with
your bucket?"</p>

<p>"I left it out in&mdash;your berry pasture."</p>

<p>"Out in my berry pasture! So you have been
stealing my berries, hey? What about your
bucket?"</p>

<p>Mirandy's little hands clutched and opened at
her sides, her face was quite pale, but she looked
straight up at Cap'n Moseby. "You took it,"
said she.</p>

<p>Cap'n Moseby looked straight back at her,
frowning terribly; then, to her great astonishment,
his mouth twitched as if he were going to
laugh. "You think I took your bucket, and you
have been waiting here all this time to get it
back, hey?" said he.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Didn't you feel afraid that I'd set the dog
on you, or shoot you out of the window with my
gun?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Mirandy.</p>

<p>"Well," said Cap'n Moseby. He paused a minute,
his mouth twitched again. "You have got
to come into the house and settle with me if you
want your bucket," he continued, and his voice
was still very grim.</p>

<p>Mirandy stepped up on the threshold, and the
black dog growled faintly.</p>

<p>"Be still, Lafayette!" said Cap'n Moseby.
"I'm going to settle with her. You lay down."</p>

<p>She followed Cap'n Moseby into his kitchen,
and he pushed a little stool towards her. "Sit
down," said he.</p>

<p>And Mirandy sat down. Directly opposite her,
on a corner of the settle, was her berry bucket,
and near it stood the gun, propped against the
wall. She eyed it. There was a vague fear in
her mind that settlement was in some way connected
with that gun; but she never flinched.
She was resolved to have that bucket.</p>

<p>Cap'n Moseby went to the dresser and got out
a large china bowl with green sprigs on it, and
a pewter spoon. He filled the bowl with berries
from Mirandy's bucket, and then poured on some
milk out of a blue pitcher. Mirandy watched
him.</p>

<p>He carried the bowl over to her, and set it in
her lap. "Eat 'em all up, now, every one," he
commanded.</p>

<p>Mirandy looked up at him pitifully. Her
courage almost failed. She thought of the boys
and the stolen fruit in the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>,
and she almost felt premonitory cramps.</p>

<p>"Eat 'em," ordered Cap'n Moseby.</p>

<p>And Mirandy ate them, thrusting the pewter
spoon, laden with those stolen berries, desperately
into her mouth. Never berries tasted like those
to her. There was no sweetness in them. But
she kept thinking how her mother could give
her boneset tea if they made her sick, and she
was determined to have the bucket back.</p>

<p>Cap'n Moseby watched her as she ate. He
emptied the remaining berries out of the bucket
into a large bowl. Then he sat opposite, on the
settle. Lafayette lay at his feet.</p>

<p>Mirandy finished the berries, and sat with the
empty bowl in her lap.</p>

<p>"Finished 'em?" asked Cap'n Moseby.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Now, Mirandy Thayer, I'm going to ask you
a question." Cap'n Moseby's eyes looked into
hers, and she looked back into his. "If you
hadn't been a little gal, Mirandy Thayer, what
would you have been?"</p>

<p>Mirandy hesitated.</p>

<p>"Hey?" said Cap'n Moseby.</p>

<p>"One of my brothers," said Mirandy, doubtfully.</p>

<div class="center"><a name="eat" id="eat"></a><a href="images/005.png">
<img src="images/005th.png" alt="image" /></a>
</div>
<p class="center">"'EAT 'EM!' ORDERED CAP'N MOSEBY"</p>

<p>"No, you wouldn't. I'll tell you what you
would have been. You would have been a soldier,
and you would have gone right up to the
redcoats' guns. Well, you must tend to your
knittin'-work and your spinnin'. Now what did
you steal my berries for, hey?"</p>

<p>"To earn my shoes," faltered Mirandy; she
felt a little bewildered.</p>

<p>"Earn your shoes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I 'ain't got any to wear to meetin'."</p>

<p>"Have to go barefoot?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, they went barefoot at Valley Forge;
that's nothing. You wait a minute, Mirandy
Thayer."</p>

<p>And Mirandy waited until Cap'n Moseby had
limped into another room and back again. He
had a pair of little rough shoes dangling in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Here," said he, "these belonged to my Ezra
that died. He had some grit in him; he'd have
done some marchin' in 'em if he'd lived. They'll
jest about fit you. It's a pity you're a little gal.
Well, you must tend to your knittin'-work and
your spinnin'. Now you'd better run home, an'
don't you ever come stealin' my berries again, or
you'll run faster than they did at Lexington."</p>

<p>And so it happened that Mirandy went home,
about three o'clock of that summer afternoon,
carrying her new shoes in her berry bucket, and
Cap'n Moseby limped along at her side. Mirandy
did not know that he went to explain
matters to her mother, so that she should not be
dealt with too severely, but she was surprised
that she received so small a chiding.</p>

<p>"Don't you ever let me hear of your doing
such a thing again," said her mother; and that
was all she said.</p>

<p>The next Sunday Mirandy went up the aisle
clattering bravely in little Ezra Moseby's shoes,
and she could not help looking often at them
during the sermon.</p>

<h2><a name="A_PARSNIP_STEW" id="A_PARSNIP_STEW"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">A PARSNIP STEW</a></h2>


<p>Ruth stood by with a dish and spoon, while
her mother stirred the stew carefully to be sure
that it was not burning on the bottom of the kettle.
Her sister Serena was paring apples and playing
with the cat, and her father and her uncles
Caleb and Silas sat before the fire smoking, sniffing
the stew, and watching solemnly. The uncles
had just come in, and proposed staying to dinner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whitman squinted anxiously at the stew
as she stirred it. She feared that there was not
enough for dinner, now there were two more to
eat.</p>

<p>"I'm dreadful afraid there ain't enough of
that stew to go round," she whispered to Ruth
in the pantry.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess it'll do," said Ruth.</p>

<p>"Well, I dun know about it. Your father an'
Caleb an' Silas are dreadful fond of parsnip stew,
an' I do hate to have 'em stinted."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't take any," said Ruth. "I
don't care much about it."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want a mouthful," rejoined her
mother. "Mebbe we can make it do. Caleb an'
Silas don't have a good hot dinner very often,
an' I do want them to have enough, anyway."</p>

<p>Caleb and Silas Whitman were old bachelors,
living by themselves in the old Whitman homestead
about a mile away, and their fare was understood
to be forlorn and desultory. To-day
they watched with grave complacency while
their sister-in-law cooked the stew.</p>

<p>Over on the other side of the kitchen the table
was set out with the pewter plates and the
blue dishes. The stew was almost done, Mrs.
Whitman was just about to dip out the slices of
pork into the dish that Ruth held, when there
was a roll of wheels out in the yard, and a great
shadow passed over the kitchen floor.</p>

<p>"Mother, it's the Wigginses!" said Ruth, in a
terrified whisper.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" sighed her mother; "they've
come to dinner."</p>

<p>Everybody stared for a second; then Mrs.
Whitman recovered herself. "Father, you go
out an' help them put the horse up. Don't sit
there any longer."</p>

<p>Then she threw open the door, and thrust her
large handsome face out into the rain. "Why,
how do you do, Mis' Wiggins?" said she, and she
smiled beamingly.</p>

<p class="center">"A PARSNIP STEW"</p>

<p>The wagon looked full of faces. On the front
seat were a large man and two little boys; out
of the gloom in the rear peered two women and a
little girl. They were Mr. Wiggins, his wife and
three children, and his mother. They were distant
relatives of Mrs. Whitman's; they often came
over to spend the day, and always unannounced.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitman came out clumsily and opened
the barn doors, and Mr. Wiggins led the horse
into the barn. "I hope you 'ain't got wet," Mrs.
Whitman said. Nothing could have exceeded
her cordiality; but all the time she was thinking
of the parsnip stew, and how it surely would
not go around now.</p>

<p>Ruth had not followed the others out to greet
the guests. She stayed by the kettle and stirred
the stew, and scowled. "I think it's downright
mean for folks to come in this way, just dinner-time,"
said she to the uncles, who had not left
their chairs. And they gave short grunts which
expressed their assent, for neither of them liked
company.</p>

<p>They watched soberly as Ruth stirred the
stew, but they did not dream that there was not
enough to go around.</p>

<p>When her mother and the guests entered,
Ruth turned around and bobbed her head stiffly,
and said, "Pretty well, thank you," and then
stirred again. Serena helped the Wigginses
take off their things. She untied old Mrs. Wiggins's
pumpkin hood, and got her cap out of her
cap basket and put it on for her. She also took
off little Mary Wiggins's coat, and set her in a
little child's arm-chair and gave her a kiss. Little
Mary Wiggins, with her sober, chubby face
and her rows of shiny brown curls, in her best
red frock and her scalloped pantalets, was noticed
admiringly by everybody but Ruth.</p>

<p>As soon as she could Ruth cornered her mother
in the pantry. "Mother, what <i>are</i> you going
to do?" said she.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to do jest the best I can," she whispered,
severely. "I'm goin' to tell father an'
Caleb an' Silas they mustn't take none of that
stew; they can have some bread an' apple-sauce.
I guess they'll git along."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't care," said Ruth, in a loud voice.
"I think it's mean and a downright imposition
on folks, coming in this way, just dinner-time."</p>

<p>"Ruth Whitman, if you care anything about
me, you'll keep still. Now you get the salt-cup
an' go out there, an' put some more salt in that
stew. It tasted dreadful flat, I thought. I jest
tasted of it when they drove in. I've got to get
out the other knives."</p>

<p>Ruth caught up a cup with a jerk. "Well,
how much shall I put in?" she inquired, sulkily.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite a lot. You can tell. It was dreadful
flat. Taste of it."</p>

<p>But Ruth did not taste of it. She scattered
the contents of the cup liberally into the stew,
gave it a stir, returned to the pantry, and set the
cup down hard. "Well," said she, "I've put it
in, and now I'm goin'."</p>

<p>"Ruth Whitman, you ain't goin' off to school
without any dinner."</p>

<p>"I don't see as there is anything for dinner but
bread and apple-sauce, and I'm sure I don't want
any."</p>

<p>"I should think you'd be ashamed of yourself,
actin' so."</p>

<p>"I think there are other folks that ought to be
ashamed of themselves. Before I'd go into folk's
houses that way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ruth Whitman, they'll hear you!"</p>

<p>"I don't care if they do. I've got to go, anyway.
It's late. I couldn't stop for dinner now
if I wanted to."</p>

<p>She went through the kitchen, where Serena
now tended the stew, only stopping to take her
shawl off the peg.</p>

<p>"Why, you going?" Serena called after her.</p>

<p>"I've got to; it's late," replied Ruth, shortly.
She faced about for a second and gave a stiff
nod, which seemed directed at the stew-kettle
rather than at the Wigginses. "Good-bye," said
she. Then she went out.</p>

<p>It was raining with a hard, steady drizzle.
Ruth had no rubbers nor water-proof&mdash;they were
not yet invented. She sped along through the
rain and mist. She had to walk half a mile to
the little house where she taught the district
school, and before she got there she felt calmer.</p>

<p>"I suppose I was silly to act so mad," she said
to herself. "I know it plagued mother."</p>

<p>It was early in the spring; the trees were
turning green in the rain. Over in the field she
could see one peach-tree in blossom, showing
pink through the mist. "I suppose Mr. Wiggins
couldn't work out to-day, and that's how they
happened to come. They could have the horse.
But they ought to have come earlier," reflected
Ruth. "There are a good many of 'em for Mrs.
Wiggins to get ready," mused Ruth. "There's
old Mrs. Wiggins and Johnny and Sammy and
Mary and Mr. Wiggins."</p>

<p>By the time Ruth was seated at her table in
the school-room, and the scholars were wriggling
and twisting before her on their wooden benches,
she saw the matter quite plainly from the Wiggins
side. She made up her mind that she would
behave just as well as she knew how to the
Wigginses when she got home. She planned
how she would swing little Mary out in the barn
and play with the boys, and how she would
help her mother get tea.</p>

<p>When school was done and Ruth started for
home the rain had stopped and the sun was shining.
The rain-pools in the road glittered, and
she noticed a cherry-tree in blossom. When she
reached home Serena met her at the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ruth Whitman!" she cried, "we have had
such a time!"</p>

<p>Ruth stared. "What do you mean?" said she.
"Where are the Wigginses?"</p>

<p>"They've gone. Mrs. Wiggins and old Mrs.
Wiggins were dreadful mad. Oh, Ruth, you
didn't do it on purpose, did you?"</p>

<p>"Do what on purpose?" said Ruth, pushing
into the house, and looking around the empty
kitchen in a bewildered way. "I don't know
what you mean."</p>

<p>"Don't you know what you put into that parsnip
stew?"</p>

<p>"No; I don't know of anything I put in but
some salt, just before I went to school; mother
told me to. Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Ruth, you put in&mdash;saleratus!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe it."</p>

<p>Ruth flew into the pantry, and came out with
a cracked blue cup. "Here," said she&mdash;"here's
the salt-cup, and this is the one I got it out of, I
know."</p>

<p>"Taste of it," said Serena, solemnly.</p>

<p>Ruth tasted. "It <i>is</i> saleratus," said she, looking
at her sister in horror. "Did it spoil the
stew?"</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;dreadful."</p>

<p>"I don't see how it happened," Ruth said,
slowly, puckering her forehead, "unless mother
dipped out some saleratus in the salt-cup to
bring out in the kitchen when she mixed the
sour-milk cakes for breakfast. I don't know anything
about it, true's I live and breathe. I
hope they didn't think I did such a mean thing
as that on purpose."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know as they really thought
you did, but you know you did kind of jerk
round, Ruth, and the Wigginses saw it."</p>

<p>"What did they say?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Serena, "we all sat down to the
table, and mother had put on the bread and apple-sauce
for the rest of us, and she helped the
Wigginses to the stew. There wasn't more'n
enough to go around, but she kept the cover over
the dish so they shouldn't suspect, and all the
rest of us said we wouldn't take any.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Wiggins she tasted, and old Mrs.
Wiggins she tasted. Then they looked at mother.
Mother she didn't know what it meant, and
she kept getting redder and redder. Finally she
spoke up. 'Is there anything the matter with
the stew?' says she.</p>

<p>"Then Mrs. Wiggins she pushed over her plate
for mother to taste of the stew, and the first
thing we knew they were all talking at once.
Old Mrs. Wiggins said she'd noticed how we
acted kind of stiff, and as if we wasn't glad to
see them, the minute she come, and Mrs. Wiggins
said she had, too, and she'd seen you put the saleratus
into the stew, and she thought from the
way you switched around you were up to something.
Mother she tried to excuse it off, but they
wouldn't hear a word. They said it didn't look
very likely that it was an accident, and they
noticed none of us took any of it, and mother
wouldn't tell them the reason for that. So they
just got up and put on their things, and Mr. Wiggins
backed out the horse, and they went home.
Mother asked them to come again, and she'd try
and have a better dinner, but they said they'd
never set foot in the house again if they knew it."</p>

<p>"Didn't anybody eat the stew?"</p>

<p>"Nobody but Sammy Wiggins; he ate his
whole plateful, saleratus and all, before anybody
spoke."</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" said Ruth; "I suppose mother
feels dreadfully. Where is she?"</p>

<p>"She's gone over to Lucy Ann's to help her
take care of the baby; he was real sick last
night. I don't believe she'll come home till
after supper. She felt dreadful."</p>

<p>"The Wigginses are dreadful touchy folks,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"Course they are. It don't seem as if anybody
with any sense would get mad at such a
thing. But they're always suspecting folks of
meaning something."</p>

<p>Ruth looked sternly reflective. She took off
her thick dingy shawl, and got from its peg a
bright red and green plaid one that she wore in
pleasant weather.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Serena.</p>

<p>"I'm going over to the Wigginses'."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to ask them to come over here to-morrow
and spend the day."</p>

<p>"Why, Ruth Whitman, ain't you afraid to?"</p>

<p>"No, I ain't afraid. I'm going to carry over
a jar of the honey&mdash;mother 'll be willing&mdash;and
I'm going to tell Mrs. Wiggins just how it was."</p>

<p>"She won't hear a word you say."</p>

<p>"I'll make her hear."</p>

<p>"They won't come a step."</p>

<p>"You see."</p>

<p>The Whitmans kept bees, and their honey was
the celebrated luxury of the neighborhood. Ruth
got a jar of clear white honey out of the closet,
put it under her shawl, and was off. First,
though, she instructed Serena to go out in the
garden and dig a good supply of parsnips and
clean them for the next day's dinner.</p>

<p>It was a mile to the Wigginses', and it took
Ruth over an hour to accomplish her errand and
return. When she got home she found Serena
getting supper, and her father was washing his
hands out in the shed; her mother had not returned.
On the kitchen sink lay a tin pan with
four or five muddy parsnips. Serena looked up
eagerly when her sister entered. "They coming?"
said she.</p>

<p>"Yes, they are," replied Ruth, with a triumphant
smile.</p>

<p>But Serena walked over to the sink and extended
her arm with a tragical gesture towards
the parsnips. "Well, you've gone and done it
now, Ruth Whitman," said she. "There's every
single parsnip that's fit to eat that I could find
in the garden."</p>

<p>"H'm! I guess I can find some."</p>

<p>"No, you can't; they've rotted. I heard mother
say to-day she was afraid they had. More'n
half those father brought in this morning weren't
good for anything. When mother finds out that
all the Wigginses are coming, and there's just five
parsnips for dinner, I don't know what she will
do; I don't know but it will kill her. And she's
asked Uncle Caleb and Uncle Silas over, too."</p>

<p>Ruth gave a desperate glance at the parsnips.
"I said we were going to have parsnip stew,"
said she, "Mrs. Wiggins had been crying; she
looked dreadful tired out; and Sammy had just
bumped his head, and there was a great lump
over one eye. She took the honey, and said
she'd be real happy to come if they could have
the horse, and old Mrs. Wiggins acted dreadful
tickled."</p>

<p>"The Wigginses have got parsnips," said Serena.
"I heard Mrs. Wiggins say they'd got a
splendid lot, she expected, but they hadn't dug
any yet."</p>

<p>Ruth looked at her sister. "Serena!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to send over and <i>buy some of the
Wigginses' parsnips</i>."</p>

<p>"Ruth!" But it seemed to Serena as if there
was a flash of red and green light through the
room, and Ruth had gone. Serena gave a little
gasp, and stood looking.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked her father, coming
in&mdash;an old man in checkered shirt sleeves,
yet with a certain rustic stateliness about him.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," said Serena; and she fell to
slicing the bread for supper.</p>

<p>While her father had gone to the well to
draw a pail of water Ruth came in, breathless,
but rosy with daring and triumph. Ben White,
Mrs. White's grown-up son, was going to drive
over to the Wigginses and buy some parsnips;
his mother was to have some, and Ruth a noble
portion for the next day's stew.</p>

<p>Serena dropped into a chair and giggled feebly;
the humor, of it was so forcible that it
seemed to fairly rebound in her face. "Ask the
Wigginses to dinner to have a parsnip stew, and
then&mdash;buy their own parsnips for it!" she gasped.</p>

<p>Ruth did not laugh at all; she saw nothing
but the seriousness of the situation. "Mind you
don't tell mother till after it's all over," said she.
"I don't want her to know where those parsnips
came from till after the Wigginses have gone,
she'll be so upset. I'm just going to tell her
how I carried the honey over there, and how
they're coming. I do hope Ben will bring the
parsnips before mother gets home."</p>

<p>"Suppose Ben should bring 'em in when mother
was here," chuckled Serena.</p>

<p>"I told him to shy into the shed with 'em,"
replied Ruth, severely. "Hush! father's coming,
and we'd better not say anything to him till
afterwards."</p>

<p>Mrs. Whitman did not return until quite late;
her married daughter Lucy Ann and her teething
baby did not generally release her in very
good season. When she came into the kitchen
she found a great pan of parsnips all washed
and scraped, and heard the news how the Wigginses
were over their ill-tempers and were coming
the next day. Mrs. Whitman dropped into
a chair, her large mild face beamed, and tears
stood in her eyes. "Well, I'm dreadful glad if
we can patch it up," said she; "I never had any
fuss with any of my folks before in the world,
and I hate to begin now. I've always thought
a good deal of the Wigginses." And her mouth
quivered.</p>

<p>The next morning a parsnip stew of noble proportions
was prepared. At eleven o'clock the
great kettle, full to the rim, hung over the fire,
and the room was cloudy with savory steam.
The Wigginses were expected every minute.
Uncles Silas and Caleb Whitman could be seen
from the kitchen window out in the field with
their brother bending over the plough furrows,
and they kept righting themselves and looking
at their old silver watches. At half-past eleven
Mrs. Whitman and Serena began to think it was
strange that the Wigginses did not come. At
quarter of twelve there was a little stir out in
the yard, and they ran to the windows. There
was Mr. Wiggins with a wheelbarrow and an
empty grain sack and a half-bushel basket of
russet apples in it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whitman and Serena stood wonderingly
in the door. "Where's the folks?" asked Mrs.
Whitman.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Wiggins, standing by the wheelbarrow,
explained how Hiram Green had had to
use the horse for ploughing up in the six-acre
lot, how he had promised to hire it to him, and
his wife hadn't known it, and how he had had
to go to the store for grain with the wheelbarrow,
and his wife had got him to stop and tell
Mis' Whitman she was dreadfully sorry it happened
so, but she didn't see how they could
walk, and they would come over the first day
they could have the horse; and she didn't know
but what Mis' Whitman's apples had give out,
so she sent her over a few of their russets; they
had 'most two barrels left, and they were spoiling
fast, and they wanted to get rid of them.</p>

<p>When Ruth came home from school she found
an immense kettle of parsnip stew, her father
and her uncles Silas and Caleb again forming a
pleasant expectant semicircle before the fire, but
no Wigginses. To-day the stew was seasoned
daintily, and salt had taken the place of saleratus.
There was no stint as to quantity, but there
were not enough partakers. Mrs. Whitman filled
a great bowl for Lucy Ann; she sent a dish
over to the Whites; father and Caleb and Silas
ate manfully, and passed their plates again and
again; Serena and Ruth and their mother ate all
they could, and the cat had her fill; but the
Whitmans, with all their allies, could not eat
their own share and that of the Wigginses. But
the stew was delicious, and as the family ate,
their simple homely little feud was healed, and
the parsnip stew smoked in their midst like a
pipe of peace.</p>

<p>"I should think it was about time for him to
be comin'," said Mrs. Rose.</p>

<p>"So should I," assented Miss Elvira Grayson.
She peered around the corner of the front door.
Her face was thin and anxious, and her voice
was so like it that it was unmistakably her own
note. One would as soon expect a crow to chick-a-dee
as Miss Elvira to talk in any other way.
She was tall, and there was a sort of dainty angularity
about her narrow shoulders. She wore
an old black silk, which was a great deal of dress
for afternoon. She had considerable money in
the bank, and could afford to dress well. She
wore also some white lace around her long neck,
and it was fastened with a handsome gold-and-jet
brooch. She was knitting some blue worsted,
and she sat back in the front entry, out of the
draft. She considered herself rather delicate.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rose sat boldly out in the yard in the full
range of the breeze, sewing upon a blue-and-white
gingham waist for her son Willy. She
was a large, pretty-faced woman in a stiffly
starched purple muslin, which spread widely
around her.</p>

<p>"He's been gone 'most an hour," she went on;
"I hope there's nothin' happened."</p>

<p>"I wonder if there's snakes in that meadow?"
ruminated Miss Elvira.</p>

<p>"I don't know; I'm gettin' ruther uneasy."</p>

<p>"I know one thing&mdash;I shouldn't let him go
off so, without somebody older with him, if he
was my boy."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know what I can do," returned
Mrs. Rose, uneasily. "There ain't anybody to
go with him. I can't go diggin' sassafras-root,
and you can't, and his uncle Hiram's too busy,
and grandfather is too stiff. And he is so crazy
to go after sassafras-root, it does seem a pity to
tell him he sha'n't. I never saw a child so possessed
after the root and sassafras-tea, as he is,
in my life. I s'pose it's good for him. I hate
to deny him when he takes so much comfort
goin'. There he is now!"</p>

<p>Little Willy Rose crossed the road, and toiled
up the stone steps. The front yard was terraced,
and two flights of stone steps led up to the front
door. He was quite breathless when he stood
on the top step; his round, sweet face was pink,
his fair hair plastered in flat locks to his wet
forehead. His little trousers and his shoes were
muddy, and he carried a great scraggy mass of
sassafras-roots. "I see you a-settin' out here,"
he panted, softly.</p>

<p>"You ought not to have stayed so long. We
began to be worried about you," said his mother,
in a fond voice. "Now go and take your muddy
shoes right off, and put on your slippers; then
you can sit down at the back door and clean
your sassafras, if you want to."</p>

<p>"I got lots," said Willy, smiling sweetly, and
wiping his forehead. "Look-a-there, Miss Elviry."</p>

<p>"So you did," returned Miss Elvira. "I suppose,
now, you think you'll have some sassafras-tea."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"I guess I'll steep him a little for supper, he's
so crazy for it," said Mrs. Rose, when Willy had
disappeared smilingly around the corner.</p>

<p>"Yes, I would. It's real wholesome for him.
Who's that comin'?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Rose stared down at the road. A white
horse with an open buggy was just turning into
the drive-way, around the south side of the terraces.
"Why, it's brother Hiram," said she,
"and he's got a boy with him. I wonder who
'tis."</p>

<p>The buggy drew up with a grating noise in
the drive-way. Presently a man appeared around
the corner. After him tagged a small white-headed
boy, and after the boy, Willy Rose, with
a sassafras-root and an old shoe-knife in his
hands.</p>

<p>The man, who was Mr. Hiram Fairbanks, Mrs.
Rose's brother, had a somewhat doubtful expression.
When he stopped, the white-headed
boy stopped, keeping a little behind him in his
shadow.</p>

<p>"What boy is that, Hiram?" asked Mrs. Rose.
Miss Elvira peered around the door. Mr. Fairbanks
was tall and stiff-looking. He had a sunburned,
sober face. "His name is Dickey," he
replied.</p>

<p>"One of those Dickeys?" Mrs. Rose said
"Dickeys," as if it were a synonym for "outcasts"
or "rascals."</p>

<p>Mr. Fairbanks nodded. He glanced at the
boy in his wake, then at Willy. "Willy, s'pose
you take this little boy 'round and show him
your rabbits," he said, in an embarrassed voice.</p>

<p>"Willy Rose!" cried his mother, "you haven't
changed those muddy shoes! Go right in this
minute, 'round by the kitchen door, and take this
boy 'round with you; he can sit down on the
door-step and help you clean your sassafras-root."</p>

<p>Willy disappeared lingeringly around the
house, and the other boy, on being further bidden
by Mr. Fairbanks, followed him. "Willy,"
his mother cried after him, "mind you sit down
on the door-step and tie your shoes! I ain't
goin' to have that Dickey boy left alone; his
folks are nothin' but a pack of thieves," she remarked
in a lower tone. "What are you doing
with him, Hiram?"</p>

<p>Hiram hesitated. "Well, 'Mandy, you was
sayin' the other day that you wished you had a
boy to run errands, and split up kindlin's, and be
kind of company for Willy."</p>

<p>"You ain't brought that Dickey boy?"</p>

<p>"Now, look here, 'Mandy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I ain't going to have him in the house."</p>

<p>"Jest look here a minute, 'Mandy, till I tell
you how it happened, and then you can do jest
as you're a mind to about it. I was up by the
Ruggles's this afternoon, and Mis' Ruggles, she
come out to the gate, and hailed me. She wanted
to know if I didn't want a boy. Seems the
Dickey woman died last week; you know the
father died two year ago. Well, there was six
children, and the oldest boy's skipped, nobody
knows where, and the oldest girl has just got
married, and this boy is the oldest of the four
that's left. They took the three little ones to
the poorhouse, and Mis' Ruggles she took this
boy in, and she wanted to keep him, but her own
boy is big enough to do all the chores, and she
didn't feel as if she could afford to. She says
he's a real nice little fellow, and his mother
wa'n't a bad woman; she was jest kind of sickly
and shiftless. I guess old Dickey wa'n't much,
but he's dead. Mis' Ruggles says this little chap
hates awful to go to the poorhouse, and it ain't
no kind of risk to take him, and she'd ought to
know. She's lived right there next door to the
Dickeys ever since she was married. I knew
you wanted a boy to do chores 'round, long as
Willy wasn't strong enough, so I thought I'd fetch
him along. But you can do jest as you're a mind
to."</p>

<p>"Now, Hiram Fairbanks, you know the name
those Dickeys have always had. S'pose I took
that boy, and he stole?"</p>

<p>"Mis' Ruggles says she'd trust him with anything."</p>

<p>"She ain't got so much as I have to lose.
There I've got two dozen solid silver teaspoons,
and four table-spoons, and my mother's silver
creamer, and Willy's silver napkin-ring. Elviry's
got her gold watch, too."</p>

<p>"I've got other things I wouldn't lose for anything,"
chimed in Miss Elvira.</p>

<p>"Well, of course, I don't want you to lose anything,"
said Mr. Fairbanks, helplessly, "but Mis'
Ruggles, she said he was perfectly safe."</p>

<p>"I s'pose I could lock up the silver spoons and
use the old pewter ones, and Elviry could keep
her watch out of sight for a while," ruminated
Mrs. Rose.</p>

<p>"Yes, I could," assented Miss Elvira, "and my
breastpin."</p>

<p>"I s'pose he could draw the water, and split
up the kindlin'-wood, and weed the flower-garden,"
said Mrs. Rose. "I set Willy to weedin'
this morning, and it gave him the headache. I
tell you one thing, Hiram Fairbanks, if I do take
this boy, you've got to stand ready to take him
back again the first minute I see anything out of
the way with him."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will, 'Mandy; I promise you I will,"
said Mr. Fairbanks, eagerly. He hurried out to
the buggy, and fumbled under the seat; then he
returned with a bundle and a small wooden box.</p>

<p>"Here's his clothes. I guess he ain't got
much," said he.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rose took the newspaper bundle; then
she eyed the box suspiciously. It was a wooden
salt-box, and the sliding cover was nailed on.</p>

<p>"What's in this?" said she.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," replied Mr. Fairbanks;
"some truck or other&mdash;I guess it ain't worth
much."</p>

<p>He put the box down on the bank, and trudged
heavily and quickly out to the buggy. He was
anxious to be off; he shook the reins, shouted
"ge lang" to the white horse, and wheeled
swiftly around the corner.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know what's in that box," said
Mrs. Rose to Miss Elvira.</p>

<p>"I hope he ain't got an old pistol or anything
of that kind in it," returned Miss Elvira. "Oh,
'Mandy, I wouldn't shake it, if I were you!"
For Mrs. Rose was shaking the wooden box, and
listening with her ear at it.</p>

<p>"Something rattles in it," said she, desisting;
"I hope it ain't a pistol." Then she entered
with the newspaper bundle and the box, and
went through the house, with Miss Elvira following.
She set the bundle and box on the kitchen
table, and looked out of the door. There on the
top step sat the Dickey boy cleaning the sassafras-roots
with great industry, while Willy Rose
sat on the lower one chewing some.</p>

<p>"I do believe he's goin' to take right hold,
Elviry," whispered Mrs. Rose.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe he is," returned Miss Elvira.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rose stowed away the boy's belongings
in the little bedroom off the kitchen where she
meant him to sleep; then she kindled the fire
and got supper. She made sassafras-tea, and the
new boy, sitting beside Willy, had a cup poured
for him. But he did not drink much nor eat
much, although there were hot biscuits and berries
and custards. He hung his forlorn head
with its shock of white hair, and only gave fleeting
glances at anything with his wild, blue eyes.
He was a thin boy, smaller than Willy, but he
looked wiry and full of motion, like a wild rabbit.</p>

<p>After supper Mrs. Rose sent him for a pail of
water; then he split up a little pile of kindling-wood.
After that he sat down on the kitchen
door-step in the soft twilight, and was silent.</p>

<p>Willy went into the sitting-room, where his
mother and Miss Elvira were. "He's settin' out
there on the door-step, not speakin' a word," said
he, in a confidential whisper.</p>

<p>"Well, you had better sit down here with us
and read your Sunday-school book," said his
mother. She and Miss Elvira had agreed that
it was wiser that Willy should not be too much
with the Dickey boy until they knew him better.</p>

<p>When it was nine o'clock Mrs. Rose showed
the Dickey boy his bedroom. She looked at him
sharply; his small pale face showed red stains
in the lamplight. She thought to herself that
he had been crying, and she spoke to him as
kindly as she could&mdash;she had not a caressing
manner with anybody but Willy. "I guess
there's clothes enough on the bed," said she. She
looked curiously at the bundle and the wooden
box. Then she unfastened the bundle. "I guess
I'll see what you've got for clothes," said she,
and her tone was as motherly as she could make
it towards this outcast Dickey boy. She laid out
his pitiful little wardrobe, and examined the
small ragged shirt or two and the fragmentary
stockings. "I guess I shall have to buy you
some things if you are a good boy," said she.
"What have you got in that box?"&mdash;the boy
hung his head&mdash;"I hope you ain't got a pistol?"</p>

<p>"No, marm."</p>

<p>"You ain't got any powder, nor anything of
that kind?"</p>

<p>"No, marm." The boy was blushing confusedly.</p>

<p>"I hope you're tellin' me the truth," Mrs.
Rose said, and her tone was full of severe admonition.</p>

<p>"Yes, marm." The tears rolled down the
boy's cheeks, and Mrs. Rose said no more. She
told him she would call him in the morning, and
to be careful about his lamp. Then she left him.
The Dickey boy lay awake, and cried an hour;
then he went to sleep, and slept as soundly as
Willy Rose in his snug little bedroom leading
out of his mother's room. Miss Elvira and Mrs.
Rose locked their doors that night, through distrust
of that little boy down-stairs who came
of a thieving family. Miss Elvira put her gold
watch and her breastpin and her pocket-book,
with seventeen dollars in it, under the feather-bed;
and Mrs. Rose carried the silver teaspoons
up-stairs, and hid them under hers. The Dickey
boy was not supposed to know they were in the
house&mdash;the pewter ones had been used for supper&mdash;but
that did not signify; she thought it
best to be on the safe side. She kept the silver
spoons under the feather-bed for many a day,
and they all ate with the pewter ones; but
finally suspicion was allayed if not destroyed.
The Dickey boy had shown himself trustworthy
in several instances. Once he was sent on a test
errand to the store, and came home promptly
with the right change. The silver spoons glittered
in the spoon-holder on the table, and Miss
Elvira wore her gold watch and her gold breastpin.</p>

<p>"I begin to take a good deal more stock in
that boy," Mrs. Rose told her brother Hiram.</p>

<p>"He ain't very lively, but he works real smart;
he ain't saucy, and I ain't known of his layin'
hands on a thing."</p>

<p>But the Dickey boy, although he had won
some confidence and good opinions, was, as Mrs.
Rose said, not very lively. His face, as he did
his little tasks, was as sober and serious as an
old man's. Everybody was kind to him, but this
poor little alien felt like a chimney-sweep in a
queen's palace. Mrs. Rose, to a Dickey boy, was
almost as impressive as a queen. He watched
with admiration and awe this handsome, energetic
woman moving about the house in her wide
skirts. He was overcome with the magnificence
of Miss Elvira's afternoon silk, and gold watch;
and dainty little Willy Rose seemed to him like
a small prince. Either the Dickey boy, born in
a republican country, had the original instincts
of the peasantry in him, and himself defined his
place so clearly that it made him unhappy, or
his patrons did it for him. Mrs. Rose and Miss
Elvira tried to treat him as well as they treated
Willy. They dressed him in Willy's old clothes;
they gave him just as much to eat; when autumn
came he was sent to school as warmly clad and
as well provided with luncheon; but they could
never forget that he was a Dickey boy. He
seemed, in truth, to them like an animal of another
species, in spite of all they could do, and they
regarded his virtues in the light of uncertain
tricks. Mrs. Rose never thought at any time of
leaving him in the house alone without hiding
the spoons, and Miss Elvira never left her gold
watch unguarded.</p>

<p>Nobody knew whether the Dickey boy was
aware of these lurking suspicions or not; he was
so subdued that it was impossible to tell how
much he observed. Nobody knew how homesick
he was, but he went about every day full of
fierce hunger for his miserable old home. Miserable
as it had been, there had been in it a certain
element of shiftless ease and happiness. The
Dickey boy's sickly mother had never chided
him; she had not cared if he tracked mud into
the house. How anxiously he scraped his feet
before entering the Rose kitchen. The Dickey
boy's dissipated father had been gentle and
maudlin, but never violent. All the Dickey
children had done as they chose, and they had
agreed well. They were not a quarrelsome family.
Their principal faults were idleness and a
general laxity of morals which was quite removed
from active wickedness. "All the Dickeys
needed was to be bolstered up," one woman in
the village said; and the Dickey boy was being
bolstered up in the Rose family.</p>

<p>They called him Dickey, using his last name
for his first, which was Willy. Mrs. Rose straightened
herself unconsciously when she found that
out. "We can't have two Willies in the family,
anyhow," said she; "we'll have to call you
Dickey."</p>

<p>Once the Dickey boy's married sister came to
see him, and Mrs. Rose treated her with such stiff
politeness that the girl, who was fair and pretty
and gaudily dressed, told her husband when she
got home that she would never go into <i>that</i>
woman's house again. Occasionally Mrs. Rose,
who felt a duty in the matter, took Dickey to
visit his little brothers and sisters at the almshouse.
She even bought some peppermint-candy
for him to take them. He really had many a
little extra kindness shown him; sometimes Miss
Elvira gave him a penny, and once Mr. Hiram
Fairbanks gave him a sweet-apple tree&mdash;that was
really quite a magnificent gift. Mrs. Rose could
hardly believe it when Willy told her. "Well,
I must say I never thought Hiram would do
such a thing as that, close as he is," said she. "I
was terribly taken aback when he gave that tree
to Willy, but this beats all. Why, odd years it
might bring in twenty dollars!"</p>

<p>"Uncle Hiram gave it to him," Willy repeated.
"I was a-showin' Dickey my apple-tree, and
Uncle Hiram he picked out another one, and he
give it to him."</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't have believed it," said Mrs.
Rose.</p>

<p>Nobody else would have believed that Hiram
Fairbanks, careful old bachelor that he was,
would have been so touched by the Dickey
boy's innocent, wistful face staring up at the
boughs of Willy's apple-tree. It was fall, and
the apples had all been harvested. Dickey
would get no practical benefit from his tree
until next season, but there was no calculating
the comfort he took with it from the minute it
came into his possession. Every minute he
could get, at first, he hurried off to the orchard
and sat down under its boughs. He felt as if
he were literally under his own roof-tree. In
the winter, when it was heavy with snow, he
did not forsake it. There would be a circle of
little tracks around the trunk.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rose told her brother that the boy was
perfectly crazy about that apple-tree, and Hiram
grinned shamefacedly.</p>

<p>All winter Dickey went with Willy to the district
school, and split wood and brought water
between times. Sometimes of an evening he
sat soberly down with Willy and played checkers,
but Willy always won. "He don't try to
beat," Willy said. Sometimes they had pop-corn,
and Dickey always shook the popper.
Dickey said he wasn't tired, if they asked him.
All winter the silver spoons appeared on the
table, and Dickey was treated with a fair show
of confidence. It was not until spring that the
sleeping suspicion of him awoke. Then one day
Mrs. Rose counted her silver spoons, and found
only twenty-three teaspoons. She stood at her
kitchen table, and counted them over and over.
Then she opened the kitchen door. "Elviry!"
she called out, "Elviry, come here a minute!
Look here," she said, in a hushed voice, when
Miss Elvira's inquiring face had appeared at the
door. Miss Elvira approached the table tremblingly.</p>

<p>"Count those spoons," said Mrs. Rose.</p>

<p>Miss Elvira's long slim fingers handled the
jingling spoons. "There ain't but twenty-three,"
she said finally, in a scared voice.</p>

<p>"I expected it," said Mrs. Rose. "Do you
s'pose he took it?"</p>

<p>"Who else took it, I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>It was a beautiful May morning; the apple-trees
were all in blossom. The Dickey boy had
stolen over to look at his. It was a round hill
of pink-and-white bloom. It was the apple year.
Willy came to the stone wall and called him.
"Dickey," he cried, "Mother wants you;" and
Dickey obeyed. Willy had run on ahead. He
found Mrs. Rose, Miss Elvira, Willy, and the
twenty-three teaspoons awaiting him in the
kitchen. He shook his head to every question
they asked him about the missing spoon. He
turned quite pale; once in a while he whimpered;
the tears streamed down his cheeks, but he
only shook his head in that mute denial.</p>

<p>"It won't make it any easier for you, holding
out this way," said Mrs. Rose, harshly. "Stop
cryin' and go out and split up some kindlin'-wood."</p>

<p>Dickey went out, his little convulsed form
bent almost double. Willy, staring at him with
his great, wondering blue eyes, stood aside to
let him pass. Then he also was sent on an
errand, while his mother and Miss Elvira had a
long consultation in the kitchen.</p>

<p>It was a half-hour before Mrs. Rose went out
to the shed where she had sent the Dickey boy
to split kindlings. There lay a nice little pile of
kindlings, but the boy had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Dickey, Dickey!" she called. But he did
not come.</p>

<p>"I guess he's gone, spoon and all," she told
Miss Elvira, when she went in; but she did not
really think he had. When one came to think
of it, he was really too small and timid a boy to
run away with one silver spoon. It did not seem
reasonable. What they did think, as time went
on and he did not appear, was that he was hiding
to escape a whipping. They searched everywhere.
Miss Elvira stood in the shed by the
wood-pile, calling in her thin voice, "Come out,
Dickey; we won't whip you if you <i>did</i> take it,"
but there was not a stir.</p>

<p>Towards night they grew uneasy. Mr. Fairbanks
came, and they talked matters over.</p>

<p>"Maybe he didn't take the spoon," said Mr.
Fairbanks, uncomfortably. "Anyhow, he's too
young a chap to be set adrift this way. I wish
you'd let me talk to him, 'Mandy."</p>

<p>"<i>You!</i>" said Mrs. Rose. Then she started up.
"I know one thing," said she; "I'm goin' to see
what's in that wooden box. I don't believe but
what that spoon's in there. There's no knowin'
how long it's been gone."</p>

<p>It was quite a while before Mrs. Rose returned
with the wooden box. She had to search
for it, and found it under the bed. The Dickey
boy also had hidden his treasures. She got the
hammer and Hiram pried off the lid, which was
quite securely nailed. "I'd ought to have had it
opened before," said she. "He hadn't no business
to have a nailed-up box 'round. Don't joggle
it so, Hiram. There's no knowin' what's in
it. There may be a pistol."</p>

<div class="center"><a name="there" id="there"></a><a href="images/007.png">
<img src="images/007th.png" alt="image" /></a>
</div>
<p class="center">"THERE, AMONG THE BLOSSOMING BRANCHES, CLUNG THE DICKEY BOY."</p>

<p>Miss Elvira stood farther off. Mr. Fairbanks
took the lid entirely off. They all peered into
the box. There lay an old clay pipe and a roll
of faded calico. Mr. Fairbanks took up the roll
and shook it out. "It's an apron," said he. "It's
his father's pipe, and his mother's apron&mdash;I&mdash;swan!"</p>

<p>Miss Elvira began to cry. "I hadn't any idea
of anything of that kind," said Mrs. Rose, huskily.
"Willy Rose, what <i>have</i> you got there?"</p>

<p>For Willy, looking quite pale and guilty, was
coming in, holding a muddy silver teaspoon.
"Where did you get that spoon? Answer me
this minute," cried his mother.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;took it out to&mdash;dig in my garden with
the&mdash;other day. I&mdash;forgot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you naughty boy!" cried his mother.
Then she, too, began to weep. Mr. Fairbanks
started up. "Something's got to be done," said
he. "The wind's changed, and the May storm
is comin' on. That boy has got to be found before
night."</p>

<p>But all Mr. Fairbanks's efforts, and the neighbors'
who came to his assistance, could not find
the Dickey boy before night or before the next
morning. The long, cold May storm began, the
flowering apple-trees bent under it, and the wind
drove the rain against the windows. Mrs. Rose
and Miss Elvira kept the kitchen fire all night,
and hot water and blankets ready. But the day
had fairly dawned before they found the Dickey
boy, and then only by the merest chance. Mr.
Fairbanks, hurrying across his orchard for a
short cut, and passing Dickey's tree, happened
to glance up at it, with a sharp pang of memory.
He stopped short. There, among the blossoming
branches, clung the Dickey boy, like a little
drenched, storm-beaten bird. He had flown to
his one solitary possession for a refuge. He was
almost exhausted; his little hands grasped a
branch like steel claws. Mr. Fairbanks took him
down and carried him home. "He was up in
his tree," he told his sister, brokenly, when he
entered the kitchen. "He's 'most gone."</p>

<p>But the Dickey boy revived after he had lain
a while before a fire and been rolled in hot blankets
and swallowed some hot drink. He looked
with a wondering smile at Mrs. Rose when she
bent over him and kissed him just as she kissed
Willy. Miss Elvira loosened her gold watch,
with its splendid, long gold chain, and put it in
his hand. "There, hold it a while," said she,
"and listen to it tick." Mr. Fairbanks fumbled
in his pocket-book and drew out a great silver
dollar. "There," said he, "you can have that to
spend when you get well."</p>

<p>Willy pulled his mother's skirt. "Mother,"
he whispered.</p>

<p>"What say?"</p>

<p>"Can't I pop some corn for him?"</p>

<p>"By-and-by." Mrs. Rose smoothed the Dickey
boy's hair; then she bent down and kissed him
again. She had fairly made room for him in her
stanch, narrow New England heart.</p>

<h2><a name="A_SWEET-GRASS_BASKET" id="A_SWEET-GRASS_BASKET"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">A SWEET-GRASS BASKET</a></h2>


<p>Nancy and Flora were going through the garden,
stepping between the squash and tomato
vines. Nancy's mother stood in the kitchen door
looking after them.</p>

<p>"Mind you don't hit your clothes on the tomatoes!"
she called out.</p>

<p>"No, we won't," they answered back. After
they had passed the last bean pole they walked
single file along the foot-path down the hill.
The tall timothy-grass rustled up almost to their
waists. Flora went first, with a light little tilt
of her starched skirts. Nancy trudged briskly
and sturdily after. Nancy's old buff calico dress,
which had been let down for her every spring
since she was seven years old, and marked its
age, like a tree, by rings of a brighter color where
the old tucks had been, did not look very well
beside Flora's pretty new blue cambric. Neither
did Nancy's old Shaker bonnet show to advantage
beside Flora's hat, with its beautiful bows
and streamers; but Nancy was not troubled
about that. She cared very little what she wore,
so long as she went somewhere. Flora always
had nicer things, but she never minded. Flora
was her cousin; she had come to live with her
when her mother died, ten years before, and her
father had considerable money. He lived in the
city.</p>

<p>The two girls were nearly the same age, but
Nancy was much the larger; she looked clumsy
and overgrown following slender little Flora.
It was like a dandelion in the wake of a violet.
After they had reached the foot of the hill, they
crossed some low meadow-land. It was quite
wet, little dark pools glimmered between the
clumps of rank grasses. Some fine pink orchid
flowers were very thick, but they did not stop to
pick any. They were going to see the Indians.
Their eyes were fixed upon some white tents
ahead. They had been there once before with
Nancy's father, but the same sensations of curiosity
and exhilarating fear were upon them now.</p>

<p>"Nancy," whispered Flora, fearfully.</p>

<p>"What say?"</p>

<p>"<i>Is</i> that a&mdash;tomahawk in that tent door?"</p>

<p>"No; it's a hoe," returned Nancy, peering with
anxious eyes.</p>

<p>Several Indian women and children were moving
about; one Indian man was scraping some
birch bark at a tent door. They did not pay
any attention to the visitors.</p>

<p>Flora nudged Nancy. "Go along," said she.</p>

<p>"No, you," returned Nancy, pushing Flora.</p>

<p>"I don't dare to."</p>

<p>They stood hesitating. Finally Nancy gave
her head a jerk. "I don't care; I'm going, if
you ain't," said she, and forward she went. Flora
followed.</p>

<p>The tents were arranged like houses on a
street, with the open doors fronting each other.
In each tent was a counter loaded with baskets
and little birch-bark canoes, and an Indian woman
sat behind it to sell them.</p>

<p>The girls went from one tent to another and
stared about them. Besides the baskets and
canoes, there were sea-gulls' wings and little fur
slippers and pouches. They saw everything.
The Indian women offered to sell, but they shook
their heads shyly and soberly.</p>

<p>Finally they went into the tent where the
Princess kept store. She was a large stout woman
and a real Indian Princess. Under the
counter a little Indian baby, fast asleep, was
swinging in a tiny hammock. Nancy and Flora
nudged each other and eyed it with awe. But
it was on the Princess's counter that they saw
<i>the</i> sweet-grass basket. They both looked at it,
then at each other. It was made of sweet-grass,
it was oblong, and had a cover and long handles.</p>

<p>Finally Flora pointed one slim little finger at
it. "How much does that cost?" she asked the
Princess.</p>

<p>"Fifty cent," replied the Princess.</p>

<p>Nancy had just eight cents at home. Flora
had nothing at all. Her father sent her money
every month, and the last instalment was all
spent. Neither of them could buy the basket,
and fifty cents sounded enormous, but their faces
were quite dignified and immovable. It might
have been the echo of their strange surroundings,
but they acted as if they had Indian blood
themselves.</p>

<p>They turned about and went out of the tent;
they crossed the old road and climbed the stone-wall.
Flora spoke as she picked her way across
the meadow. "Guess I'll buy that basket when
my money comes next week," said she.</p>

<p>Nancy said nothing; she looked gloomy. She
stepped in an oozy place and wet one foot, but
she did not mind it. She thought of her eight
cents, and did an example in mental arithmetic.
"Eight from fifty leaves forty-two," she calculated.
For the first time she was envious of
Flora. Everybody finds some object to grudge
to another. Nancy had found hers&mdash;the sweet-grass
basket. If she had expressed her feelings,
she would have said, "Must she have all those
pretty dresses and hats and the sweet-grass
basket, too?"</p>

<p>The girls went home silently; they were never
great talkers. Flora sat down in the sitting-room
with her aunt; Nancy went up-stairs to
the chamber where she slept with Flora, and got
her little purse out of the corner of her bureau
drawer. She counted the eight cents, and puzzled
over the problem how to increase it to fifty.
She puzzled over it all the rest of that day until
she went to sleep at nine o'clock. The next day
was Sunday; she puzzled over it as she sat in
the pew in church, but she could not arrive at
any solution.</p>

<p>However, the next morning she had an inspiration.
Her mother sent her over to Aunt Lucretia's
on an errand. Flora was not allowed to
go; it was a very hot morning, and she was
rather delicate. Nancy on her way to Aunt
Lucretia's thought of a way to swell eight cents
to fifty. She trudged down the sunny road in a
cloud of dust, her face was scarlet with the heat,
but she ignored all little discomforts.</p>

<p>Aunt Lucretia lived in a nice square white
house with a green lattice-work porch over the
front door. She was an elderly lady and quite
rich. She had a Brussels carpet in the parlor
and kept a servant-maid.</p>

<div class="center"><a name="she" id="she"></a><a href="images/008.png">
<img src="images/008th.png" alt="image" /></a>
</div>
<p class="center">"SHE WAS A REAL INDIAN PRINCESS"</p>

<p>Nancy went in the side door, and through the
sitting-room into the front entry. The parlor
door stood open. Aunt Lucretia and her servant,
Henrietta, were in there. Nancy stood looking
in.</p>

<p>"Aunt Lucretia," said she.</p>

<p>Aunt Lucretia came forward, with Henrietta
following.</p>

<p>"Well, Nancy, what do you want?" said Aunt
Lucretia. She was quite a majestic old lady,
very tall and large and short-waisted. She wore
her gray hair in two puffs each side of her face.</p>

<p>"Mother sent your Stanford paper back," replied
Nancy.</p>

<p>"Well, you can lay it on the sitting-room
table," said Aunt Lucretia. "Is your mother
well this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>Nancy laid the Stanford paper on the sitting-room
table; then she followed on into the kitchen
after Aunt Lucretia and Henrietta.</p>

<p>"Is there anything else you want, Nancy?"
asked Aunt Lucretia.</p>

<p>"I wanted to know if&mdash;I didn't know but&mdash;you'd
like to have me pick some blackberries for
you, Aunt Lucretia."</p>

<p>"Blackberries?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>Aunt Lucretia stared reflectively at Nancy.
"Do you suppose your mother would be willing?
The sun's pretty hot."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am. I know she wouldn't care."</p>

<p>"Well, I do want two quarts of blackberries
dreadfully, and there 'ain't a boy been along.
I'm going to have the minister and his wife to
tea to-night, and I want to have blackberry shortcake.
Do you suppose you could pick me two
quarts before four o'clock this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am. I know where they're real
thick."</p>

<p>"Well," said Aunt Lucretia, "you can go
home and ask your mother, and if she's willing,
you can go and pick them. Mind you keep
out of the sun all you can. I'll give you seven
cents a quart; that's a cent more than the boys
ask."</p>

<p>"Don't you want more'n two quarts, Aunt
Lucretia?" asked Nancy, timidly.</p>

<p>"I guess two quarts will be about all you'll
want to pick," returned Aunt Lucretia, grimly.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am; it won't."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll see how you hold out. I want
four quarts for jell the last of the week; but you
pick two quarts first, and see."</p>

<p>Nancy went home. She ran nearly all the
way.</p>

<p>"You go right into the sitting-room, and sit
down with the palm-leaf fan, and cool off before
you do anything else," said her mother, when she
proposed the plan; "you'll have a sun-stroke."</p>

<p>So Nancy had to sit in the dark, cool sitting-room
and fan herself for full twenty minutes
before she was allowed to put on her old dress
and Shaker and start on her berrying excursion.
Flora wanted to go, too, but her aunt thought it
was too hot; she was apt to have headaches. She
sat on the back door-step shelling pease when
Nancy started.</p>

<p>Nancy, bustling off with her two-quart tin pail,
glanced back at Flora's little yellow shaven head
bending patiently over the pan of pease in the
doorway. She felt guilty. Was she not going
off with the secret intention of earning money
enough to buy that sweet-grass basket before
Flora could? Flora would not have her money
until Saturday; this was Monday. If she could
only earn the forty-two cents in the mean time.</p>

<p>Nancy worked hard that week. Her hands
and arms got scratched; she had even a scratch
across her nose. The blackberry vines seemed
almost like tangible foes; but she pushed and
tussled with them until she had picked the six
quarts.</p>

<p>On Monday Aunt Lucretia had the minister
and his wife to tea, and made blackberry shortcake;
on Friday she made blackberry jelly.
All Nancy's part of the contract was promptly
fulfilled, but Aunt Lucretia's was not. She had
not a cent of change in her purse when Nancy
brought in the last instalment of berries.</p>

<p>"You'll have to wait two or three days until
I can get this bill changed," said she. "You've
been real smart about picking 'em. You've
picked 'em clean, too. Here's a piece of sweet-cake
for you."</p>

<p>Nancy went home in the hot sun. Her red,
scratched face looked gloomy and discouraged in
the depths of the Shaker bonnet. She nibbled
at the sweet-cake as she went along, but she did
not care for it. Here it was Friday forenoon,
and she had to wait two or three days for her
forty-two cents. Flora's money would come,
and she would buy the sweet-grass basket. Nancy
felt quite desperate. That afternoon she
teased her mother to let her go over to Aunt
Lucretia's again.</p>

<p>"No; you don't go a step," said her mother.
"She's making jell', and you've been over there
once to-day. You can sit down with your knitting-work
this afternoon, and be contented."</p>

<p>Nancy sat down with her knitting-work, but
she was not contented. It seemed to her that
she must have those forty-two cents. After tea
she begged again for permission to go to Aunt
Lucretia's. "It's real nice and cool out now,
mother," she pleaded.</p>

<p>"I don't care how cool it is," said her mother,
"you can't go. I don't see what has got into
you."</p>

<p>But the next morning Nancy was really sent
over to Aunt Lucretia's on an errand. She did
the errand, then she stood waiting.</p>

<p>"Did your mother want anything else?" asked
Aunt Lucretia.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you had better run home then.
It's baking day, and maybe you can help your
mother some. You'd ought to help her all you
can, you're getting to be a big girl. I used to do
a whole week's baking before I was your age."</p>

<p>"Aunt Lucretia!"</p>

<p>"What say?"</p>

<p>"Have you&mdash;got that&mdash;bill&mdash;changed yet?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't. You mustn't tease. I'm
going down to the store in a day or two, and
then you can have it."</p>

<p>So Nancy went home again without her forty-two
cents. She wept a little on the way. Here
it was Saturday, and Flora expecting her money
on the noon mail. But it did not come on the
noon mail. It did not come until six o'clock at
night, and Flora did not think of buying the
basket that day.</p>

<p>After tea that night, about half-past seven
o'clock, Nancy did something that she had never
done before in her life. She went over to her Aunt
Lucretia's without permission. Her mother had
gone to one of the neighbor's. Flora was in the
sitting-room reading a story-book. Nancy stole
out of the front door, and hurried down the road.</p>

<p>"What are you over here again for, child?"
Aunt Lucretia cried when she went in.</p>

<p>Aunt Lucretia and Henrietta were in the
kitchen, sticking papers over the jelly tumblers.</p>

<p>Nancy hesitated, and blushed.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Aunt Lucretia.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;didn't know but&mdash;what&mdash;you might have
got&mdash;that bill changed."</p>

<p>"Why, I never saw such an acting child!
Can't you wait a minute? Henrietta, have you
got any change?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Henrietta. And she got
her purse, and they counted out forty-two cents.
Twenty-two of them were in pennies.</p>

<p>"Now I hope you're satisfied," said Aunt Lucretia,
sharply. "Did your mother know you
came over here?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Well, you're a naughty girl. I'm surprised
at you. I sha'n't want to hire you to pick berries
again if this is the way you do. Go right
home, and mind you tell your mother you've
been here."</p>

<p>The forty-two cents, twenty-two of which were
pennies, jingled and weighed heavily in Nancy's
pocket. She was not happy going home. She
had meditated going to the Indian encampment
that night to buy the basket, but it looked so
dark over the fields that she was afraid to; so
she went straight home. Her mother had returned
from the neighbor's; there she stood in
the front door, watching for her.</p>

<p>"Nancy Mann, I want to know where you've
been," she cried out, as soon as Nancy opened
the gate.</p>

<p>"Over to&mdash;Aunt Lucretia's."</p>

<p>"You went over there, after all the times I
told you not to?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"I wanted my&mdash;forty-two cents."</p>

<p>"Forty-two cents! What do you suppose your
Aunt Lucretia thinks of you, dunning her up this
way? Now you come in and light your candle,
and go straight up-stairs to bed."</p>

<p>It was only half-past eight o'clock. Nancy
went to bed. Flora sat up and read her story-book,
and did not go up-stairs until after nine.
Nancy pretended to be asleep when she came in,
but she was not. She did not go to sleep for an
hour after that. She lay there and cried softly,
and planned.</p>

<p>The next morning was very pleasant. It was
Sunday, and all the family went to church.
After church, Nancy and Flora went to Sunday-school.
Sunday-school was out about one
o'clock; then they walked homeward together.
Nancy lagged behind, and Flora kept waiting
for her.</p>

<p>"Go along; do," said Nancy. "I want to pick
these flowers."</p>

<p>Flora wondered innocently what Nancy wanted
to pick so many flowers for. The flowers
were mostly yarrow and arnica blossoms, and
Flora had always regarded them as the very commonest
kind of weeds.</p>

<p>They were quite near home, when Nancy
climbed swiftly over the stone-wall and lay down
behind it. Flora went on without turning her
head. Nancy had spoken so shortly to her that
her feelings were hurt. When she went into the
house her aunt asked where Nancy was.</p>

<p>"She's coming," said Flora. "She stopped to
pick flowers."</p>

<p>But it was a half-hour before Nancy came.
Running as fast as she could over the meadows,
it took some time to reach the Indian encampment
and return. When she finally approached
the house, her mother stood in the doorway,
watching. She did not say a word until she
came close to her.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" she inquired.</p>

<p>Nancy hung her head, and was still. She kept
one hand behind her.</p>

<p>"Answer me this minute."</p>

<p>"Down to&mdash;the Injuns."</p>

<p>"What for? What are you holding behind
you?"</p>

<p>Nancy did not answer.</p>

<p>"Bring your hand round!" commanded her
mother.</p>

<p>Nancy slowly swung around the hand holding
the sweet-grass basket.</p>

<p>"Did you go down to the Injuns to-day, and
spend that money you earned for that basket?"
asked her mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>Her mother looked at her. The tears were
streaming over her hot cheeks and her scratched
nose; her best hat had slipped back, and the
brim was bent; there was a great green stain on
the front of her best dress, and a rent on the side.</p>

<p>"I can never get that green off your dress in
the world," said her mother. "You'll have to
wear it so. Going down to the Injuns to buy
baskets on Sunday, in your best dress and hat!
And you went so Flora shouldn't get it. I can
see right through you. Now, Nancy Mann, you
just march straight back with that basket. You
ain't going to do any trading on the Sabbath
day while you belong to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother!" sobbed Nancy; but she had to
go. Her forlorn little figure disappeared lingeringly
between the garden vines and bean poles.</p>

<p>"Hold your dress back," called her mother.
"Don't you spoil it any more than you've done
already."</p>

<p>To Nancy, looking through a mist of tears, the
green-clad bean poles seemed dancing forward
and the tomato vines creeping to meet her.
Crossing the meadow she wet her feet in her best
shoes. But all this was nothing. That stout
Indian Princess displayed suddenly a sense of
humor and a witty shrewdness which seemed abnormal.
Her stolid eyes twinkled under their
heavy brows when Nancy explained, tremblingly,
how she had brought the basket back; her
mother would not let her buy it on Sunday.</p>

<p>"Me no buy basket Sunday," said the Princess,
and she looked loftily away from the sweet-grass
basket shaking in Nancy's shaking hand. She
was not in the least moved by Nancy's horrified,
distressed face. Perhaps something of the ancient
cruelty of her race possessed her; perhaps
it was only the contagion of Yankee shrewdness.
Nancy dared not go home with the basket; she
went home without it or her fifty cents.</p>

<p>All that afternoon Nancy stayed up in her
chamber and wept, while her best dress was soaking
to remove the green stain, if it was Sunday.
She felt as if her heart were broken. She had
lost her self-respect, the sweet-grass basket, and
her fifty cents, besides getting a great green stain
on her best dress. Flora tried to comfort her.</p>

<p>"Don't cry," said she. "It's too bad! The
Princess is real mean." And then Nancy sobbed
harder.</p>

<p>When her mother was getting supper, her
father followed into the pantry.</p>

<p>"I declare I feel sorry for the child," said he.
"She's worked real hard to get that money, and
she'ain't ever had so much as Flora. If it wasn't
Sunday I'd go down there this minute, and get
back the money or the basket from those Injuns."</p>

<p>"You'd look pretty going, and you a deacon
of the church, after the way the Princess put it,"
returned Nancy's mother. "I'm sorry enough
for Nancy, but she ought to have a little lesson.
You can go over there to-morrow morning and
get the basket back."</p>

<p>There was a beautiful custard pudding for supper,
but Nancy did not want any.</p>

<p>"Sit up and eat your supper," said her mother.
"Your father's going down to the Injuns in the
morning, and see what he can do about it."</p>

<p>However, Nancy still did not care for the custard
pudding; everything tasted of tears.</p>

<p>The next morning, before Nancy's father had
a chance to go to the Indians, the Princess herself
came to the back door. Whether she came from
honesty or policy nobody could tell; but she
came, and she brought the sweet-grass basket.
She rapped on the door, and Nancy opened it.
The Princess extended the basket without a
word. Nancy wiped her hands, which were
damp from washing the breakfast dishes, on her
apron, then she took the basket. Then the
Princess struck off across the garden.</p>

<p>Nancy carried the basket into the kitchen.
She had a shamefaced and resolute expression.
Flora was in there, and her father and
mother.</p>

<p>She went straight to Flora, and held out the
basket. Flora drew back, and looked at her.</p>

<p>"Take it," said Nancy. "It's for you."</p>

<p>Flora looked at her aunt.</p>

<p>"Take it, if she wants you to," said Mrs.
Mann.</p>

<p>Flora took it. "Thank you," said she. She
went soberly out of the room with the basket.
Nancy returned to her dish-washing at the sink,
her father stared out of the window, her mother
came and shoved her aside, and took the dish-cloth
out of her hands.</p>

<p>"There, I'll wash this heavy spider," said she.
"You can go and put on your other dress. I
want you to go down to the store for me, and
I'm going to let you buy a couple of yards of
that pretty pink calico for a new apron."</p>

<p>Nancy had admired that pink calico. As she
went out of the kitchen her father caught her
by the shoulders and gave her a little shake;
then he patted her head.</p>

<p>"Don't run too fast, and get all tired out,"
said he.</p>

<p>Nancy put on her buff calico, and went to the
store. It was an errand to take about an hour.
She had been gone about a half-hour when the
Indian Princess again came through the bean
poles and tomato vines. This time she was all
strung about with baskets. She stood at the
kitchen door, and parleyed with Mrs. Mann and
Flora. When she went away she had a fifty-cent
piece in one brown fist, and she was eating
a molasses cooky.</p>

<p>Nancy came home with the pink calico, and
half a pound of cream of tartar; her mother and
Flora were in the sitting-room, and they laughed
when she entered.</p>

<p>Nancy looked soberly at them. "Here's the
calico, and the cream tartar," said she.</p>

<p>"See what Flora has got for you," said her
mother.</p>

<p>Nancy stared around. There on the table
stood two sweet-grass baskets exactly alike.</p>

<p>"The Princess came again, and she had another
basket. I got it for you," said Flora.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Nancy, in a sober voice,
but the dark depths of the Shaker bonnet seemed
fairly illumined with smiles.</p>

<h2><a name="MEHITABLE_LAMB" id="MEHITABLE_LAMB"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">MEHITABLE LAMB</a></h2>


<p>Hannah Maria Green sat on the north door-step,
and sewed over and over a seam in a sheet.
She had just gotten into her teens, and she was
tall for her age, although very slim. She wore a
low-necked, and short-sleeved, brown delaine
dress. That style of dress was not becoming,
but it was the fashion that summer. Her neck
was very thin, and her collar-bones showed. Her
arms were very long and small and knobby.
Hannah Maria's brown hair was parted from her
forehead to the back of her neck, braided in two
tight braids, crossed in a flat mass at the back of
her head, and surmounted by a large green-ribbon
bow. Hannah Maria kept patting the bow
to be sure it was on.</p>

<p>It was very cool there on the north door-step.
Before it lay the wide north yard full
of tall waving grass, with some little cinnamon
rose-bushes sunken in it. Hardly anybody used
the north door, so there was no path leading
to it.</p>

<p>It was nearly four o'clock. Hannah Maria
bent her sober freckled face over the sheet, and
sewed and sewed. Her mother had gone to the
next town to do some shopping, and bidden her
to finish the seam before she returned. Hannah
Maria was naturally obedient; moreover,
her mother was a decided woman, so she had
been very diligent; in fact the seam was nearly
sewed.</p>

<p>It was very still&mdash;that is, there were only the
sounds that seem to make a part of stillness.
The birds twittered, the locusts shrilled, and the
tall clock in the entry ticked. Hannah Maria
was not afraid, but she was lonesome. Once
in a while she looked around and sighed. She
placed a pin a little way in advance on the seam,
and made up her mind that when she had sewed
to that place she would go into the house and
get a slice of cake. Her mother had told her
that she might cut a slice from the one-egg cake
which had been made that morning. But before
she had sewed to the pin, little Mehitable Lamb
came down the road. She was in reality some
years younger than Hannah Maria, but not so
much younger as Hannah Maria considered her.
The girl on the door-step surveyed the one approaching
down the road with a friendly and
patronizing air.</p>

<p>"Holloa!" she sang out, when Mehitable was
within hailing distance.</p>

<p>"Holloa!" answered back Mehitable's little,
sweet, deferential voice.</p>

<p>She came straight on, left the road, and struck
across the grassy north yard to Hannah Maria's
door-step. She was a round, fair little girl; her
auburn hair was curled in a row of neat, smooth
"water curls" around her head. She wore a
straw hat with a blue ribbon, and a blue-and-white
checked gingham dress; she also wore
white stockings and patent leather "ankle-ties."
Her dress was low-necked and short-sleeved, like
Hannah Maria's, but her neck and arms were
very fair and chubby.</p>

<p>Mehitable drew her big china doll in a doll's
carriage. Hannah Maria eyed her with seeming
disdain and secret longing. She herself had given
up playing with dolls, her mother thought her too
big; but they had still a fascination for her, and
the old love had not quite died out of her breast.</p>

<p>"Mother said I might come over and stay an
hour and a half," said Mehitable.</p>

<p>Hannah Maria smiled hospitably. "I'm keepin'
house," said she. "Mother's gone to Lawrence."</p>

<p>Mehitable took her doll out of the carriage
with a motherly air, and sat down on the door-step
with it in her lap.</p>

<p>"How much longer you goin' to play with
dolls?" inquired Hannah Maria.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Mehitable, with a little
shamed droop of her eyelids.</p>

<p>"You can't when you get a little bigger, anyhow.
Is that a new dress she's got on?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Aunt Susy made it out of a piece of
her blue silk."</p>

<p>"It's handsome, isn't it? Let me take her a
minute." Hannah Maria took the doll and cuddled
it up against her shoulder as she had used
to do with her own. She examined the blue
silk dress. "My doll had a real handsome plaid
silk one," said she, and she spoke as if the doll
were dead. She sighed.</p>

<p>"Have you given her away?" inquired Mehitable,
in a solemn tone.</p>

<p>"No; she's packed away. I'm too old to play
with her, you know. Mother said I had other
things to 'tend to. Dolls are well 'nough for
little girls like you. Here, you'd better take her;
I've got to finish my sewin'."</p>

<p>Hannah Maria handed back the doll with a
resolute air, but she handed her back tenderly;
then she sewed until she reached the pin. Mehitable
rocked her doll, and watched.</p>

<p>When Hannah Maria reached the pin she
jumped up. "I'm comin' back in a minute,"
said she, and disappeared in the house. Presently
Mehitable heard the dishes rattle.</p>

<p>"She's gone after a cooky," she thought.
Cookies were her usual luncheon.</p>

<p>But Hannah Maria came back with a long
slice of one-egg cake with blueberries in it. She
broke it into halves, and gave the larger one to
Mehitable. "There," said she, "I'd give you
more, but mother didn't tell me I could cut
more'n one slice."</p>

<p>Mehitable ate her cake appreciatively; once in
a while she slyly fed her doll with a bit.</p>

<p>Hannah Maria took bites of hers between the
stitches; she had almost finished the over-and-over
seams.</p>

<p>Presently she rose and shook out the sheet with
a triumphant air. "There," said she, "it's done."</p>

<p>"Did you sew all that this afternoon?" asked
Mehitable, in an awed tone.</p>

<p>"My! yes. It isn't so very much to do."</p>

<p>Hannah Maria laid the sheet down in a heap
on the entry floor; then she looked at Mehitable.
"Now, I've nothin' more to do," said she.
"S'pose we go to walk a little ways?"</p>

<p>"I don't know as my mother'd like to have
me do that."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, she would; she won't care. Come
along! I'll get my hat."</p>

<p>Hannah Maria dashed over the sheet into the
entry and got her hat off the peg; then she and
Mehitable started. They strolled up the country
road. Mehitable trundled her doll-carriage carefully;
once in a while she looked in to see if the
doll was all right.</p>

<p>"Isn't that carriage kind of heavy for you to
drag all alone?" inquired Hannah Maria.</p>

<p>"No; it isn't very heavy."</p>

<p>"I had just as lief help you drag it as not."</p>

<p>Hannah Maria reached down and took hold
by one side of the handle of the doll-carriage,
and the two girls trundled it together.</p>

<p>There were no houses for a long way. The
road stretched between pasture-lands and apple-orchards.
There was one very fine orchard on
both sides of the street a quarter of a mile below
Hannah Maria's house. The trees were
so heavily loaded with green apples that the
branches hung low over the stone walls. Now
and then there was among them a tree full of
ripe yellow apples.</p>

<p>"Don't you like early apples?" asked Hannah
Maria.</p>

<p>Mehitable nodded.</p>

<p>"Had any?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"They don't grow in your field, do they?"</p>

<p>Mehitable shook her head. "Mother makes
pies with our apples, but they're not mellow
'nough to eat now," she replied.</p>

<p>"Well," said Hannah Maria, "we haven't got
any. All our apples are baldwins and greenin's.
I havn't had an early apple this summer."</p>

<p>The two went on, trundling the doll-carriage.
Suddenly Hannah Maria stopped.</p>

<p>"Look here," said she; "my aunt Jenny and
my uncle Timothy have got lots of early apples.
You just go along this road a little farther, and
you get to the road that leads to their house.
S'pose we go."</p>

<p>"How far is it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not very far. Father walks over sometimes."</p>

<p>"I don't believe my mother would like it."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, she would! Come along."</p>

<p>But all Hannah Maria's entreaties could not
stir Mehitable Lamb. When they reached the
road that led to Uncle Timothy's house she stood
still.</p>

<p>"My mother won't like it," said she.</p>

<p>"Yes, she will."</p>

<p>Mehitable stood as if she and the doll-carriage
were anchored to the road.</p>

<p>"I think you're real mean, Mehitable Lamb,"
said Hannah Maria. "You're a terrible 'fraid
cat. I'm goin', anyhow, and I won't bring you
a single apple; so there!"</p>

<p>"Don't want any," returned Mehitable, with
some spirit. She turned the doll-carriage around.
Hannah Maria walked up the road a few steps.
Suddenly she faced about. Mehitable had already
started homeward.</p>

<p>"Mehitable Lamb!" said she.</p>

<p>Mehitable looked around.</p>

<p>"I s'pose you'll go right straight home and tell
my mother just as quick as you can get there."</p>

<p>Mehitable said nothing.</p>

<p>"You'll be an awful telltale if you do."</p>

<p>"Sha'n't tell," said Mehitable, in a sulky voice.</p>

<p>"Will you promise&mdash;'Honest and true. Black
and blue. Lay me down and cut me in two'&mdash;that
you won't tell?"</p>

<p>Mehitable nodded.</p>

<p>"Say it over then."</p>

<p>Mehitable repeated the formula. It sounded
like inaudible gibberish.</p>

<p>"I shall tell her myself when I get home,"
said Hannah Maria. "I shall be back pretty
soon, anyway, but I don't want her sending father
after me. You're sure you're not goin' to tell,
now, Mehitable Lamb? Say it over again."</p>

<p>Mehitable said it again.</p>

<p>"Well, you'll be an awful telltale if you do
tell after that!" said Hannah Maria.</p>

<p>She went on up one road towards her uncle
Timothy Dunn's, and Mehitable trundled her
doll-carriage homeward down the other. She
went straight on past Hannah Maria's house.
Hannah Maria's mother, Mrs. Green, had come
home. She saw the white horse and buggy out
in the south yard. She heard Mrs. Green's voice
calling, "Hannah Maria, Hannah Maria!" and
she scudded by like a rabbit.</p>

<p>Mehitable's own house was up the hill, not far
beyond. She lived there with her mother and
grandmother and her two aunts; her father was
dead. The smoke was coming out of the kitchen
chimney; her aunt Susy was getting supper.
Aunt Susy was the younger and prettier of the
aunts. Mehitable thought her perfection. She
came to the kitchen door when Mehitable entered
the yard, and stood there smiling at her.</p>

<p>"Well," said she, "did you have a nice time at
Hannah Maria's?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"What makes you look so sober?"</p>

<p>Mehitable said nothing.</p>

<p>"Did you play dolls?"</p>

<p>"Hannah Maria's too big."</p>

<p>"Stuff!" cried Aunt Susy. Then her shortcake
was burning, and she had to run in to see to it.</p>

<p>Mehitable took her china doll out of the carriage,
set her carefully on the step, and then
lugged the carriage laboriously to a corner of the
piazza, where she always kept it. It was a very
nice large carriage, and rather awkward to be
kept in the house. Then she took her doll and
went in through the kitchen to the sitting-room.
Her mother and grandmother and other aunt
were in there, and they were all glad to see her,
and inquired if she had had a nice time at Hannah
Maria's. But Mehitable was very sober.
She did not seem like herself. Her mother asked
whether she did not feel well, and, in spite of her
saying that she did, would not let her eat any of
her aunt Susy's shortcake for supper. She had
to eat some stale bread, and shortly after supper
she had to go to bed. Her mother went up-stairs
with her, and tucked her in.</p>

<p>"She's all tired out," she said to the others,
when she came down; "it's quite a little walk over
to the Greens', and I s'pose she played hard. I
don't really like to have her play with a girl so
much older as Hannah Maria. She isn't big
enough to run and race."</p>

<p>"She didn't seem like herself when she came
into the yard," said Aunt Susy.</p>

<p>"I should have given her a good bowl of
thoroughwort tea, when she went to bed," said
her grandmother.</p>

<p>"The kitchen fire isn't out yet; I can steep
some thoroughwort now," said Aunt Susy, and
she forthwith started. She brewed a great bowl
of thoroughwort tea and carried it up to Mehitable.
Mehitable's wistful innocent blue eyes
stared up out of the pillows at Aunt Susy and
the bowl.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"A bowl of nice hot thoroughwort tea. You
sit up and drink it right down, like a good little
girl."</p>

<p>"I'm not sick, Aunt Susy," Mehitable pleaded,
faintly. She hated thoroughwort tea.</p>

<p>"Well, never mind if you're not. Sit right up.
It'll do you good."</p>

<p>Aunt Susy's face was full of loving determination.
So Mehitable sat up. She drank the
thoroughwort tea with convulsive gulps. Once
in a while she paused and rolled her eyes piteously
over the edge of the bowl.</p>

<p>"Drink it right down," said Aunt Susy.</p>

<p>And she drank it down. There never was a
more obedient little girl than Mehitable Lamb.
Then she lay back, and Aunt Susy tucked her
up, and went down with the empty bowl.</p>

<p>"Did she drink it all?" inquired her grandmother.</p>

<p>"Every mite."</p>

<p>"Well, she'll be all right in the morning, I
guess. There isn't anything better than a bowl
of good, hot, thoroughwort tea."</p>

<p>The twilight was deepening. The Lamb family
were all in the sitting-room. They had not
lighted the lamp, the summer dusk was so pleasant.
The windows were open. All at once a
dark shadow appeared at one of them. The
women started&mdash;all but Grandmother Lamb. She
was asleep in her chair.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" Aunt Susy asked, in a grave
tone.</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything of Hannah Maria?"
said a hoarse voice. Then they knew it was Mr.
Green.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lamb and the aunts pressed close to the
window.</p>

<p>"No, we haven't," replied Mrs. Lamb. "Why,
what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"We can't find her anywheres. Mother went
over to Lawrence this afternoon, and I was down
in the east field hayin'. Mother, she got home
first, and Hannah Maria wasn't anywhere about
the house, an' she'd kind of an idea she'd gone
over to the Bennets'; she'd been talkin' about
goin' there to get a tidy-pattern of the Bennet
girl, so she waited till I got home. I jest put
the horse in again, an' drove over there, but she's
not been there. I don't know where she is.
Mother's most crazy."</p>

<p>"Where is she?" they cried, all altogether.</p>

<p>"Sittin' out in the road, in the buggy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lamb and the aunts hurried out. They
and Mr. Green stood beside the buggy, and Mrs.
Green thrust her anxious face out.</p>

<p>"Oh, where do you suppose she is?" she
groaned.</p>

<p>"Now, do keep calm, Mrs. Green," said Mrs.
Lamb, in an agitated voice. "We've got something
to tell you. Mehitable was over there this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"Oh, she wasn't, was she?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she was. She went about four o'clock,
and she stayed an hour and a half. Hannah Maria
was all right then. Now, I tell you what
we'll do, Mrs. Green: you just get right out of
the buggy, and Mr. Green will hitch the horse,
and we'll go in and ask Mehitable just how she
left Hannah Maria. Don't you worry. You keep
calm, and we'll find her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Green stepped tremblingly from the buggy.
She could scarcely stand. Mrs. Lamb took
one arm and Aunt Susy the other. Mr. Green
hitched the horse, and they all went into the
house, and up-stairs to Mehitable's room. Mehitable
was not asleep. She stared at them in a
frightened way as they all filed into the room.
Mrs. Green rushed to the bed.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mehitable," she cried, "when did you
last see my Hannah Maria?"</p>

<p>Mehitable looked at her and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Tell Mrs. Green when you last saw Hannah
Maria," said Mrs. Lamb.</p>

<p>"I guess 'twas 'bout five o'clock," replied Mehitable,
in a quavering voice.</p>

<p>"She got home at half-past five," interposed
Mehitable's mother.</p>

<p>"Did she look all right?" asked Mrs. Green.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Nobody came to the house when you were
there, did there?" asked Mr. Green.</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>Aunt Susy came forward. "Now look here,
Mehitable," said she. "Do you know anything
about what has become of Hannah Maria?
Answer me, yes or no."</p>

<p>Mehitable's eyes were like pale moons; her
little face was as white as the pillow.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Well, what has become of her?"</p>

<p>Mehitable was silent.</p>

<p>"Why, Mehitable Lamb!" repeated Aunt Susy,
"tell us this minute what has become of Hannah
Maria!"</p>

<p>Mehitable was silent.</p>

<p>"Oh," sobbed Mrs. Green, "you must tell me.
Mehitable, you'll tell Hannah Maria's mother
what has become of her, won't you?"</p>

<p>Mehitable's mother bent over her and whispered,
but Mehitable lay there like a little stone
image.</p>

<p>"Oh, do make her tell!" pleaded Mrs. Green.</p>

<p>"Come, now, tell, and I'll buy you a whole
pound of candy," said Mr. Green.</p>

<p>"Mehitable, you <i>must</i> tell," said Aunt Susy.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mehitable began to cry. She sobbed
and sobbed; her little body shook convulsively.
They all urged her to tell, but she only shook her
head between the sobs.</p>

<p>Grandmother Lamb came into the room. She
had awakened from her nap.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" she inquired. "What
ails Mehitable? Is she sick?"</p>

<p>"Hannah Maria is lost, and Mehitable knows
what has become of her, and she won't tell," explained
Aunt Susy.</p>

<p>"Massy sakes!" Grandmother Lamb went up
to the bed. "Tell grandmother," she whispered,
"an' she'll give you a pep'mint."</p>

<p>But Mehitable shook her head and sobbed.</p>

<p>They all pleaded and argued and commanded,
but they got no reply but that shake of the head
and sobs.</p>

<p>"The child will be sick if she keeps on this
way," said Grandmother Lamb.</p>

<p>"She deserves to be sick!" said Hannah Maria's
mother, in a desperate voice; and Mehitable's
mother forgave her.</p>

<p>"We may as well go down," said Mr. Green,
with a groan. "I can't waste any more time
here; I've got to do something."</p>

<p>"Oh, here 'tis night coming on, and my poor
child lost!" wailed Hannah Maria's mother.</p>

<p>Mehitable sobbed so that it was pitiful in spite
of her obstinacy.</p>

<p>"If that child don't have somethin' to take,
she'll be sick," said her grandmother. "I dunno
as there's any need of her bein' sick if Hannah
Maria is lost." And she forthwith went stiffly
down-stairs. The rest followed&mdash;all except Mrs.
Lamb. She lingered to plead longer with Mehitable.</p>

<p>"You're mother's own little girl," said she,
"and nobody shall scold you whatever happens.
Now, tell mother what has become of Hannah
Maria."</p>

<p>But it was of no use. Finally, Mrs. Lamb
tucked the clothes over Mehitable with a jerk,
and went down-stairs herself. They were having
a consultation there in the sitting-room. It was
decided that Mr. Green should drive to Mr. Pitkin's,
about a quarter of a mile away, and see if
they knew anything of Hannah Maria, and get
Mr. Pitkin to aid in the search.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't go over to Timothy's to-night, if I
were you," said Mrs. Green. "Jenny's dreadful
nervous, and it would use her all up; she thought
so much of Hannah Maria."</p>

<p>Mrs. Green's voice broke with a sob.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not going there," returned Mr. Green.
"It isn't any use. It isn't likely they know anything
about her. It's a good five mile off."</p>

<p>Mr. Green got into his buggy and drove away.
Mrs. Green went home, and Aunt Susy and the
other aunt with her. Nobody slept in the Lamb
or the Green house that night, except Grandmother
Lamb. She dozed in her chair, although
they could not induce her to go to bed. But
first she started the kitchen fire, and made another
bowl of thoroughwort tea for Mehitable.</p>

<p>"She'll be sick jest as sure as the world, if she
doesn't drink it," said she. And Mehitable lifted
her swollen, teary face from the pillow and drank
it. "She don't know any more where that Green
girl has gone to than I do," said Grandmother
Lamb, when she went down with the bowl.
"There isn't any use in pesterin' the child so."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lamb watched for Mr. Green to return
from Mr. Pitkin's, and ran out to the road. He had
with him Mr. Pitkin's hired man and eldest boy.</p>

<p>"Pitkin's harnessed up and gone the other
way, over to the village, and we're goin' to look
round the place thorough, an'&mdash;look in the well,"
he said, in a husky voice.</p>

<p>"If she would only tell," groaned Mrs. Lamb.
"I've done all I can. I can't <i>make</i> her speak."</p>

<p>Mr. Green groaned in response, and drove on.
Mrs. Lamb went in, and stood at her sitting-room
window and watched the lights over at the Green
house. They flitted from one room to another
all night. At dawn Aunt Susy ran over with
her shawl over her head. She was wan and
hollow-eyed.</p>

<p>"They haven't found a sign of her," said she.
"They've looked everywhere. The Pitkin boy's
been down the well. Mr. Pitkin has just come
over from the village, and a lot of men are going
out to hunt for her as soon as it's light. If Mehitable
only would tell!"</p>

<p>"I can't make her," said Mrs. Lamb, despairingly.</p>

<p>"I know what I think you'd ought to do," said
Aunt Susy, in a desperate voice.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"<i>Whip her.</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, Susy, I can't! I never whipped her in
my life."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't care. I should." Aunt Susy
had the tragic and resolute expression of an inquisitor.
She might have been proposing the
rack. "I think it is your duty," she added.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lamb sank into the rocking-chair and
wept; but within an hour's time Mehitable stood
shivering and sobbing in her night-gown, and
held out her pretty little hands while her mother
switched them with a small stick. Aunt Susy
was crying down in the sitting-room. "Did she
tell?" she inquired, when her sister, quite pale
and trembling, came in with the stick.</p>

<p>"No," replied Mrs. Lamb. "I never will whip
that dear child again, come what will." And
she broke the stick in two and threw it out of
the window.</p>

<p>As the day advanced teams began to pass the
house. Now and then one heard a signal horn.
The search for Hannah Maria was being organized.
Mrs. Lamb and the aunts cooked a hot
breakfast, and carried it over to Mr. and Mrs.
Green. They felt as if they must do something
to prove their regret and sympathy. Mehitable
was up and dressed, but her poor little auburn
locks were not curled, and the pink roundness
seemed gone from her face. She sat quietly in
her little chair in the sitting-room and held her
doll. Her mother had punished her very tenderly,
but there were some red marks on her
little hands. She had not eaten any breakfast,
but her grandmother had kindly made her
some thoroughwort tea. The bitterness of life
seemed actually tasted to poor little Mehitable
Lamb.</p>

<p>It was about nine o'clock, and Mrs. Lamb and
the aunts had just carried the hot breakfast over
to the Green's, and were arranging it on the
table, when another team drove into the yard.
It was a white horse and a covered wagon. On
the front seat sat Hannah Maria's aunt, Jenny
Dunn, and a young lady, one of Hannah Maria's
cousins. Mrs. Green ran to the door. "Oh,
Jenny, <i>have</i> you heard?" she gasped. Then she
screamed, for Hannah Maria was peeking out of
the rear of the covered wagon. She was in there
with another young lady cousin, and a great
basket of yellow apples.</p>

<p>"Hannah Maria Green, where <i>have</i> you been?"
cried her mother.</p>

<p>"Why, what do you think! That child walked
'way over to our house last night," Aunt Jenny
said, volubly; "and Timothy was gone with the
horse, and there wasn't anything to do but to
keep her. I knew you wouldn't be worried about
her, for she said the little Lamb girl knew where
she'd gone, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Green jerked the wagon door open and
pulled Hannah Maria out. "Go right into the
house!" she said, in a stern voice. "Here she
wouldn't tell where you'd gone. And the whole
town hunting! Go in."</p>

<p>Hannah Maria's face changed from uneasy and
deprecating smiles to the certainty of grief. "Oh,
I made her promise not to tell, but I s'posed she
would," she sobbed. "I didn't know 'twas going
to be so far. Oh, mother, I'm sorry!"</p>

<p>"Go right in," said her mother.</p>

<p>And Hannah Maria went in. Aunt Susy and
Mrs. Lamb pushed past her as she entered. They
were flying home to make amends to Mehitable,
with kind words and kisses, and to take away the
taste of the thoroughwort tea with sponge-cake
and some of the best strawberry jam.</p>

<p>Later in the forenoon Mehitable, with the row
of smooth water-curls round her head, dressed in
her clean pink calico, sat on the door-step with
her doll. Her face was as smiling as the china
one. Hannah Maria came slowly into the yard.
She carried a basket of early apples. Her eyes
were red. "Here are some apples for you," she
said. "And I'm sorry I made you so much
trouble. I'm not going to eat any."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mehitable. "Did your
mother scold?" she inquired, timidly.</p>

<p>"She did first. I'm dreadful sorry. I won't
ever do so again. I&mdash;kind of thought you'd tell."</p>

<p>"I'm not a telltale," said Mehitable.</p>

<p>"No, you're not," said Hannah Maria.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
